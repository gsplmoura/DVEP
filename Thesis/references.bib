abstract = {This investigation aimed to compare the effects of suspension training versus traditional resistance exercise using a combination of bands and bodyweight on body composition, bioimpedance vector patterns, and handgrip strength in older men. Thirty-six older men (age 67.4 ± 5.1 years, BMI 27.1 ± 3.3 kg/m2) were randomly allocated into suspension training (n = 12), traditional training (n = 13), or non-exercise (n = 11) groups over a 12-week study period. Body composition was assessed using conventional bioelectrical impedance analysis and classic and specific bioelectric impedance vector analysis, and handgrip strength was measured with a dynamometer. Results showed a significant (p < 0.05) group by time interaction for fat mass, fat-free mass, total body water, skeletal muscle index, classic and specific bioelectrical resistance, classic bioelectrical reactance, phase angle, and dominant handgrip strength. Classic and specific vector displacements from baseline to post 12 weeks for the three groups were observed. Handgrip strength increased in the suspension training group (p < 0.01, ES: 1.50), remained stable in the traditional training group, and decreased in the control group (p < 0.01, ES: −0.86). Although bodyweight and elastic band training helps to prevent a decline in muscle mass and handgrip strength, suspension training proved more effective in counteracting the effects of aging in older men under the specific conditions studied.},

The versions of 2002-2003 and 2008-2009 of the Household Budget Survey (POF) from the IBGE bring two questions on the subjective evaluation of Brazilian families about the sufficiency of their income. While the first question draws direct information on the degree of family's satisfaction with its monthly income, allowing to build from it a qualitative indicator of income sufficiency, the second question extracts information on the income value evaluated by the family as minimally necessary for covering their monthly expenses, allowing to build from it a quantitative indicator of income sufficiency, defined as the proportion to which the actual income exceeds that value. In looking into the empirical relationship between these two subjective indicators, the work can contribute not only to support these indicators as reliable measures of quality of life of Brazilian families},

abstract = {Spirituality can be defined as a belief system focusing on intangible elements  that impart vitality and meaning to life's events. Often spirituality is expressed through formalized religions. Recently, the interplay of spirituality, religion, and health care has been explored in the medical literature. Spiritual belief systems impact on the incidences, experiences, and outcomes of several common medical problems. Unfortunately, there is little recent literature addressing the process of conducting a medically oriented spiritual history. One approach to assisting the physician in spiritual history taking, a mnemonic, SPIRIT, is presented as a guide to identifying important components of the spiritual history. This article addresses the issues of when and whom to interview, as well as specific professional and ethical issues related to this topic. Two case examples from my practice are presented to illustrate the utility of the SPIRITual history.},

First, terms such as religion, humanism, and spirituality are defined. Second, based on his research team's previous systematic review of quantitative studies published in the peer-reviewed literature prior to 2010, the author discusses the findings from that research on the effects of religion and spirituality (R/S) on (1) mental health-well-being, purpose in life, hope, optimism, self-esteem, depression, anxiety, suicide, and substance abuse; (2) health behaviors-exercise, diet, cigarette smoking, and risky sexual activity; and (3) physical health-coronary artery disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality. Third, the author examines the latest research on the prevalence of spiritual needs among individuals with serious or terminal medical illnesses, the consequences of ignoring those needs, and the results of clinical trials that have examined the effects of spiritual assessments by physicians. Finally, the author reviews the research currently being conducted at Duke University on the efficacy of religious cognitive-behavioral therapies and on the effects of religious involvement on telomere length in stressed caregivers. Resources are provided that will assist seasoned researchers and clinicians who might be interested in doing research in this novel and expanding area of whole-person medicine.},

It is based on a systematic review of original data-based quantitative research published in peer-reviewed journals between 1872 and 2010, including a few seminal articles published since 2010. First, I provide a brief historical background to set the stage. Then I review research on R/S and mental health, examining relationships with both positive and negative mental health outcomes, where positive outcomes include well-being, happiness, hope, optimism, and gratefulness, and negative outcomes involve depression, suicide, anxiety, psychosis, substance abuse, delinquency/crime, marital instability, and personality traits (positive and negative). I then explain how and why R/S might influence mental health. Next, I review research on R/S and health behaviors such as physical activity, cigarette smoking, diet, and sexual practices, followed by a review of relationships between R/S and heart disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, immune functions, endocrine functions, cancer, overall mortality, physical disability, pain, and somatic symptoms. I then present a theoretical model explaining how R/S might influence physical health. Finally, I discuss what health professionals should do in light of these research findings and make recommendations in this regard.},

abstract = {Context Religion and spirituality (r/s) are important resources in coping with cancer. However, there are aspects of r/s, such as religious and spiritual struggles, found to be associated with poorer outcomes. A new measure has been adapted from the Religious and Spiritual Struggles Scale (RSS) to assess r/s struggles: the RSS-14. This concise measure allows for the assessment of multiple types of r/s struggles for people from different religious backgrounds or none. Objectives The aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence, predictors and correlates of r/s struggles as measured by the RSS-14 and its subdomains in a cancer population receiving palliative care. Methods Data were collected from six outpatient palliative care services across the US. Inclusion criteria for patients were age 55 or older with a cancer diagnosis. In addition to demographic and r/s characteristics, study measures included the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), the Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI) and the Quality of Life at the End of Life (QUAL-E). Results The study included 331 participants. Some r/s struggle was reported by 66%, moderate to high struggle for at least one item was reported by 20% of the patients. In bivariate analyses, r/s struggle was associated with greater symptom burden, greater dignity-related problems and poorer quality of life; in multivariable analyses, dignity-related problems remained a predictor of total r/s struggle. Conclusion R/S struggles may compromise well-being for cancer patients receiving palliative care. Clinicians should consider periodic screening for r/s struggles and referrals for spiritual care if indicated.},

abstract = {Introduction: Despite increasing evidence of the benefits of spiritual care and  nurses' efforts to incorporate spiritual interventions into palliative care and clinical practice, the role of spirituality is not well understood and implemented. There are divergent meanings and practices within and across countries. Understanding the delivery of spiritual interventions may lead to improved patient outcomes. Aim: We conducted a systematic review to characterize spiritual interventions delivered by nurses and targeted outcomes for patients in hospitals or assisted long-term care facilities. Methodology: The systematic review was developed following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, and a quality assessment was performed. Our protocol was registered on PROSPERO (Registration No. CRD42020197325). The CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases were searched from inception to June 2020. Results: We screened a total of 1005 abstracts and identified 16 experimental and quasi-experimental studies of spiritual interventions delivered by nurses to individuals receiving palliative care or targeted at chronic conditions, such as advanced cancer diseases. Ten studies examined existential interventions (e.g., spiritual history, spiritual pain assessment, touch, and psychospiritual interventions), two examined religious interventions (e.g., prayer), and four investigated mixed interventions (e.g., active listening, presence, and connectedness with the sacred, nature, and art). Patient outcomes associated with the delivery of spiritual interventions included spiritual well-being, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion: Spiritual interventions varied with the organizational culture of institutions, patients' beliefs, and target outcomes. Studies showed that spiritual interventions are associated with improved psychological and spiritual patient outcomes. The studies' different methodological approaches and the lack of detail made it challenging to compare, replicate, and validate the applicability and circumstances under which the interventions are effective. Further studies utilizing rigorous methods with operationalized definitions of spiritual nursing care are recommended.},

abstract = {The State of the Science in Spirituality and Palliative Care was convened to address the current landscape of research at the intersection of spirituality and palliative care and to identify critical next steps to advance this field of inquiry. Part II of the SOS-SPC report addresses the state of extant research and identifies critical research priorities pertaining to the following questions: 1) How do we assess spirituality? 2) How do we intervene on spirituality in palliative care? And 3) How do we train health professionals to address spirituality in palliative care? Findings from this report point to the need for screening and assessment tools that are rigorously developed, clinically relevant, and adapted to a diversity of clinical and cultural settings. Chaplaincy research is needed to form professional spiritual care provision in a variety of settings, and outcomes assessed to ascertain impact on key patient, family, and clinical staff outcomes. Intervention research requires rigorous conceptualization and assessments. Intervention development must be attentive to clinical feasibility, incorporate perspectives and needs of patients, families, and clinicians, and be targeted to diverse populations with spiritual needs. Finally, spiritual care competencies for various clinical care team members should be refined. Reflecting those competencies, training curricula and evaluation tools should be developed, and the impact of education on patient, family, and clinician outcomes should be systematically assessed.},

abstract = {Background Hot flashes are common in women during menopause, and are an important cause of discomfort, increasing the number of medical appointments. Hormone replacement therapy is an effective treatment, but it can bring undesirable consequences. Alternative treatments exist but they are not universally accepted or effective. The ingestion of malagueta peppers (popular name for fruits of Capsicum frutescens L., Solanaceae) causes sensations similar to those experienced by women during hot flashes. Using the homeopathic law of similars (let like be cured by like), we hypothesized that a homeopathic remedy made of malagueta peppers can be effective in alleviating menopausal hot flashes. We named this remedy Malagueta. Methods This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase-2 clinical trial was designed to test the hypothesis that, in menopausal women, the homeopathic medicine Malagueta (30 CH), compared with placebo, will significantly reduce the intensity of hot flashes, after 4 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome was the intensity of hot flashes, measured by the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP) instrument. A total of 40 women were enrolled in the study, 20 in each group. Results The effect of Malagueta on the primary outcome, the intensity of hot flashes, assessed by MYMOP, was superior to that of placebo over the 4 weeks of treatment, with worsening in both groups after treatment was interrupted (after week 4, p < 0.001 in ordinal logistic regression). The odds ratio for treatment response (reduction of at least three MYMOP categories) was 2.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 10.05). Treatment with Malagueta, compared with placebo, also reduced the intensity of the secondary symptoms (p = 0.001) and improved level of activity (p = 0.025) and well-being (p = 0.008). Conclusion The homeopathic medicine of Capsicum frutescens (Malagueta) was superior to placebo in reducing the intensity of hot flashes in menopausal women after 4 weeks of treatment.},

abstract = {Background: Because of the rising number of scientific publications, it is important to have a means of jointly summarizing and assessing different studies on a single topic. Systematic literature reviews, meta-analyses of published data, and meta-analyses of individual data (pooled reanalyses) are now being published with increasing frequency. We here describe the essential features of these methods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Methods: This article is based on a selective literature search. The different types of review and meta-analysis are described, the methods used in each are outlined so that they can be evaluated, and a checklist is given for the assessment of reviews and meta-analyses of scientific articles. Results: Systematic literature reviews provide an overview of the state of research on a given topic and enable an assessment of the quality of individual studies. They also allow the results of different studies to be evaluated together when these are inconsistent. Meta-analyses additionally allow calculation of pooled estimates of an effect. The different types of review and meta-analysis are discussed with examples from the literature on one particular topic. Conclusions: Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses enable the research findings and treatment effects obtained in different individual studies to be summed up and evaluated.},

abstract = {Eclipta prostrata L. (EPL), a medicinal plant, is widely utilized in the central highlands of Vietnam. This study aims to assess the chemical profile and potential medical effects of an EPL extract rich in flavonoids. A total of 36 secondary metabolites were identified from the EPL extract through GC-MS and UHPLC-UV analysis. Among them, 15 volatile compounds and several phenolic and flavonoid chemicals, including salicylic acid, epicatechin gallate, isovitexin, and apigetrin, were reported in EPL extract for the first time. This herbal extract demonstrated moderate inhibition against $\alpha$-amylase and $\alpha$-glucosidase, and high anti-oxidant and anti-acetylcholinesterase activities (IC50 = 76.8 ± 0.8 $\mu$g/mL). These promising attributes can be likely attributed to the high levels of major compounds, including wedelolactone (1), chlorogenic acid (3), epicatechin gallate (6), salicylic acid (8), isovitexin (9), apigetrin (11), and myricetin (12). These findings align with the traditional use of EPL for enhancing memory and cognitive function, as well as its potential benefits in diabetes management. The results of the molecular docking study reveal that the major identified compounds (1, 6, 9, and 11) showed a more effective acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effect than berberine chloride, with good binding energy (DS values, −12.3 to −14.3 kcal/mol) and acceptable values of RMSD (1.02–1.67 {\AA}). Additionally, almost all the identified major compounds exhibited good ADMET properties within the required limits.},

Since a popular medicinal plant Ecliptaalba contains various bioactive molecules, the present study aimed to observe the biochemical and histological changes in liver associated with acute oral toxicity (LD 50 ) of aqueous extract of E. alba (L.) Hassk. in female Swiss albino mice. Materials and Methods: For the acute oral toxicity study, the animals were divided into six groups of 6 mice each. Group-I was normal control and the treatment groups were administered aqueous leaf extract of E. alba orally at different doses of 500 mg (group-I),1750 mg (group-III), 2000 mg (group-IV), 2500 mg (group-V) and 3000 mg/kg/b.wt.(group-VI) for seven consecutive days. The mice were sacrificed on the eighth day and blood was collected for the analysis of ALP (alkaline phosphatase), SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transferase), total protein and albumin. The liver was dissected, weighed, and processed for histopathological analysis. Results: The LD 50 was found to be 2316.626 mg/kg/body weight in female mice. Serum SGPT, total protein and albumin increased in treated group-IV (P < 0.05), V (P < 0.01), and VI (P < 0.01) as compared to the control (group-I). ALP level significantly decreased in the treated group-IV (P < 0.05), V (P < 0.01) and VI (P < 0.01). Histopathological changes were observed at dose of 2000 mg (group-IV), 2500 mg (group-V) and 3000 mg (group-VI). Conclusion: It was concluded that oral administration of aqueous leaf extract of E. alba had detrimental effects on biochemical parameters and induced histopathological alterations in liver of female Swiss albino mice at doses higher than 2000 mg/kg/day indicating that its indiscriminate use should be avoided.},

abstract = {The public and patients can be powerful sensors for shaping and powering healthcare research. They are joining research teams as investigators and collaborators to co-produce evidence for the practical use of interventions in clinical practice. While clinicians and researchers are encouraged by funders and policymakers to involve the public and patients as partners in research, knowledge on what involvement consists of is limited, and the continuum between consultation, collaboration and co-production are not clearly defined. In this article, we explore Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) and introduce greater involvement through research co-production. Co-production describes ways that research partnership can work through public and patient involvement and we outline the similarities of co-production to “The Commons”, a strategy utilized by economists to increase effective use of resources. We share examples of how public and patient involvement have used co-production, to demonstrate financial and health benefits. We then outline practical challenges at system, social and cultural levels and consider how others have worked to resolve them.},

abstract = {Objective Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can reduce medical errors increasing drug prescription appropriateness. Deepening knowledge of existing CDSSs could increase their use by healthcare professionals in different settings (ie, hospitals, pharmacies, health research centres) of clinical practice. This review aims to identify the characteristics common to effective studies conducted with CDSSs. Materials and methods The article sources were Scopus, PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE and Web of Science, queried between January 2017 and January 2022. Inclusion criteria were prospective and retrospective studies that reported original research on CDSSs for clinical practice support; studies should describe a measurable comparison of the intervention or observation conducted with and without the CDSS; article language Italian or English. Reviews and studies with CDSSs used exclusively by patients were excluded. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was prepared to extract and summarise data from the included articles. Results The search resulted in the identification of 2424 articles. After title and abstract screening, 136 studies remained, 42 of which were included for final evaluation. Most of the studies included rule-based CDSSs that are integrated into existing databases with the main purpose of managing disease-related problems. The majority of the selected studies (25 studies; 59.5%) were successful in supporting clinical practice, with most being pre-post intervention studies and involving the presence of a pharmacist. Discussion and conclusion A number of characteristics have been identified that may help the design of studies feasible to demonstrate the effectiveness of CDSSs. Further studies are needed to encourage CDSS use.},

@article{Lee2014,
abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the impact of a high-alert medication clinical decision support system called HARMLESS on point-of-order entry errors in a tertiary hospital. Method: HARMLESS was designed to provide three kinds of interventions for five high-alert medications: clinical knowledge support, pop-ups for erroneous orders that block the order or provide a warning, and order recommendations. The impact of this program on prescription order was evaluated by comparing the orders in 6 month periods before and after implementing the program, by analyzing the intervention log data, and by checking for order pattern changes. Result: During the entire evaluation period, there were 357,417 orders and 5233 logs. After HARMLESS deployment, orders that omitted dilution fluids and exceeded the maximum dose dropped from 12,878 and 214 cases to 0 and 9 cases, respectively. The latter nine cases were unexpected, but after the responsible programming error was corrected, there were no further such cases. If all blocking interventions were seen as errors that were prevented, this meant that 4137 errors (3584 of which were 'dilution fluid omitted' errors) were prevented over the 6-month post-deployment period. There were some unexpected order pattern changes after deployment and several unexpected errors emerged, including intramuscular or intravenous push orders for potassium chloride (although a case review revealed that the drug was not actually administered via these methods) and an increase in pro re nata (PRN; administer when required) orders for most drugs. Conclusion: HARMLESS effectively implemented blocking interventions but was associated with the emergence of unexpected errors. After a program is deployed, it must be monitored and subjected to data analysis to fix bugs and prevent the emergence of new error types.},

abstract = {Background: Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) for Prescribing are one of the innovations designed to improve physician practice performance and patient outcomes by reducing prescription errors. This study was therefore conducted to examine the effects of various CDSSs on physician practice performance and patient outcomes. Methods: This systematic review was carried out by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library from 2005 to 2019. The studies were independently reviewed by two researchers. Any discrepancies in the eligibility of the studies between the two researchers were then resolved by consulting the third researcher. In the next step, we performed a meta-analysis based on medication subgroups, CDSS-type subgroups, and outcome categories. Also, we provided the narrative style of the findings. In the meantime, we used a random-effects model to estimate the effects of CDSS on patient outcomes and physician practice performance with a 95% confidence interval. Q statistics and I2 were then used to calculate heterogeneity. Results: On the basis of the inclusion criteria, 45 studies were qualified for analysis in this study. CDSS for prescription drugs/COPE has been used for various diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases, AIDS, appendicitis, kidney disease, malaria, high blood potassium, and mental diseases. In the meantime, other cases such as concurrent prescribing of multiple medications for patients and their effects on the above-mentioned results have been analyzed. The study shows that in some cases the use of CDSS has beneficial effects on patient outcomes and physician practice performance (std diff in means = 0.084, 95% CI 0.067 to 0.102). It was also statistically significant for outcome categories such as those demonstrating better results for physician practice performance and patient outcomes or both. However, there was no significant difference between some other cases and traditional approaches. We assume that this may be due to the disease type, the quantity, and the type of CDSS criteria that affected the comparison. Overall, the results of this study show positive effects on performance for all forms of CDSSs. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the positive effects of the CDSS can be due to factors such as user-friendliness, compliance with clinical guidelines, patient and physician cooperation, integration of electronic health records, CDSS, and pharmaceutical systems, consideration of the views of physicians in assessing the importance of CDSS alerts, and the real-time alerts in the prescription.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Obesity is a chronic disease that results in substantial global morbidity and mortality. The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, a novel glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, in people with obesity are not known. METHODS In this phase 3 double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned 2539 adults with a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or more, or 27 or more and at least one weight-related complication, excluding diabetes, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly, subcutaneous tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) or placebo for 72 weeks, including a 20-week dose-escalation period. Coprimary end points were the percentage change in weight from baseline and a weight reduction of 5% or more. The treatment-regimen estimand assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation in the intention-to-treat population. RESULTS At baseline, the mean body weight was 104.8 kg, the mean BMI was 38.0, and 94.5% of participants had a BMI of 30 or higher. The mean percentage change in weight at week 72 was -15.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], -15.9 to -14.2) with 5-mg weekly doses of tirzepatide, -19.5% (95% CI, -20.4 to -18.5) with 10-mg doses, and -20.9% (95% CI, -21.8 to -19.9) with 15-mg doses and -3.1% (95% CI, -4.3 to -1.9) with placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). The percentage of participants who had weight reduction of 5% or more was 85% (95% CI, 82 to 89), 89% (95% CI, 86 to 92), and 91% (95% CI, 88 to 94) with 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg of tirzepatide, respectively, and 35% (95% CI, 30 to 39) with placebo; 50% (95% CI, 46 to 54) and 57% (95% CI, 53 to 61) of participants in the 10-mg and 15-mg groups had a reduction in body weight of 20% or more, as compared with 3% (95% CI, 1 to 5) in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). Improvements in all prespecified cardiometabolic measures were observed with tirzepatide. The most common adverse events with tirzepatide were gastrointestinal, and most were mild to moderate in severity, occurring primarily during dose escalation. Adverse events caused treatment discontinuation in 4.3%, 7.1%, 6.2%, and 2.6% of participants receiving 5-mg, 10-mg, and 15-mg tirzepatide doses and placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In this 72-week trial in participants with obesity, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg of tirzepatide once weekly provided substantial and sustained reductions in body weight.

The factor structure of the\ncombined BDI and BAI items was virtually identical\nto that reported by Beck for a sample of diagnosed\ndepressed and anxious patients, supporting the view\nthat these clinical states are more severe\nexpressions of the same states that may be discerned\nin normals.

abstract = {Objective To investigate the predictive value of glycosylated serum protein (GSP) combined with glycemic variability (GV) in persistent inflammation immunosuppressive catabolic syndrome (PICS) in elderly septic patients. Methods A retrospective study was conducted. The septic patients aged ≥ 60 years old with 28 days hospitalized duration admitted to geriatric intensive care unit (ICU) of Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command from January 2014 to December 2017 were enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether PICS occurred within 14 days after ICU admission according to the PICS diagnostic criteria. General patients' data including gender, age, underlying disease, site of infection, the length of ICU stay were collected, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation Ⅱ (APACHE Ⅱ), GSP at 1 day after hospitalization and lymphocyte count (LYM), C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PA) levels at 1 day and 14 days were recorded. The levels of blood glucose on the 1st day and 14th day were observed, the GV was calculated. Data were cross-validated using the random forest method. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the predictive value of glycemic parameters for PICS. Results A total of 315 elderly septic patients were included. Patients with malignant tumors, severe autoimmune diseases, and immunosuppressive therapy or dead within 28 days of hospitalization were excluded. A total of 132 patients were enrolled in the analysis, including 45 in the PICS group and 87 in the non-PICS group. The length of ICU stay in the PICS group was significantly longer than that in the non-PICS group [days: 35.0 (22.0, 49.5) vs. 8.0 (5.0, 23.0), P < 0.01]. No significant difference in the baseline data of gender, age, underlying disease, infection site or APACHE Ⅱ score between the two groups was found. ① Parameters for PICS diagnosis: with the prolongation of ICU stay, LYM and PA in the non-PICS group were increased and those in the PICS group were decreased, and CRP and ALB levels were decreased in both groups. LYM, ALB and PA levels in the PICS group were significantly lower than those in the non-PICS group at 14 days after ICU admission [LYM (×109/L): 0.6 (0.5, 0.7) vs. 1.1 (0.9, 1.6), ALB (g/L): 25.4±2.7 vs. 29.9±4.3, PA (g/L): 0.08 (0.05, 0.14) vs. 0.11 (0.10, 0.21), all P < 0.01], and CRP level was significantly higher than that in the non-PICS group (mg/L: 87.5±56.3 vs. 49.2±49.1, P < 0.01). ② Glycemic parameters: the GSP level of the PICS group at 1 day after ICU admission was significantly lower than that of the non-PICS group (mmol/L: 2.3±0.6 vs. 2.7±0.6, P < 0.01), but there was no statistically significant difference in the level of blood glucose or GV at 1 day and 14 days after ICU admission as compared with the non-PICS group [blood glucose (mmol/L): 10.0±3.3 vs. 9.4±3.3 at 1 day, 10.8±3.6 vs. 10.4±3.5 at 14 days; GV: (24.2±1.4)% vs. (23.7±1.2)% at 1 day, (24.8±7.8)% vs. (24.7±7.7)% at 14 days, all P > 0.05]. ③ ROC curve analysis: 1-day GSP as well as 1-day and 14-day GV had certain predictive value for PICS secondary to sepsis in the elderly. The predictive value of 1-day GSP combined with 14-day GV was the highest, its area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.637, with a sensitivity of 95.8% and a specificity of 25.0%, while the positive likelihood ratio was 1.278, the negative likelihood ratio was 0.167, the positive predictive value was 71.9%, and the negative predictive value was 75.0%. Conclusion GSP combined with GV could effectively predict secondary PICS in elderly septic patients.},

In recent years, the rising prevalence of obesity has led to an increase in the number of cirrhosis cases related to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Malnutrition, obesity and sarcopenic obesity may worsen the prognosis of patients with liver cirrhosis and lower their survival. Nutritional monitoring and intervention is therefore crucial in chronic liver disease. These Clinical Practice Guidelines review the present knowledge in the field of nutrition in chronic liver disease and promote further research on this topic. Screening, assessment and principles of nutritional management are examined, with recommendations provided in specific settings such as hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhotic patients with bone disease, patients undergoing liver surgery or transplantation and critically ill cirrhotic patients.},

METHODS: Participants were scanned with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Adiposity was expressed as fat mass index (FMI, fat mass kg ÷ m2) and percentage of body fat (%fat). Lean mass was expressed as lean mass index (LMI, lean mass ÷ m2). Regression models and 2 ×2 tables were used to assess the relation of BMI to FMI,%fat, and LMI. RESULTS: Age and BMI accounted (R2) for 90% to 94% of the variability of FMI and LMI in each sex. Associations with %fat were weaker (R2s ∼0.70). We also examined the screening abilities of a BMI ≥ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 95th percentile for high levels of adiposity and LMI. Cut points were chosen so that prevalences of high values of these variables would be similar to that for high BMI. Of participants with a high BMI, 88% had a high FMI, and 76% had a high %fat. Participants with a high BMI were 29 times more likely to have a high FMI than those with lower BMIs; comparable relative risks were 12 for high %fat and 14 for high LMI. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its limitations, a high BMI is a very good screening tool for identifying children and adolescents with elevated adiposity.},

abstract = {Background: Delayed mortality in sepsis often is linked to a lack of resolution in the inflammatory cascade termed persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS). Limited research exists on PICS in pediatric patients with sepsis. Research Question: What is the prevalence of pediatric PICS (pPICS) in patients who died of sepsis-related causes and what associated pathogen profiles and comorbidities did they have compared with those patients without pPICS who died from sepsis? Study Design and Methods: A retrospective study of a single institution using a de-identified database from 1997 through 2020 for all patients aged 21 years or younger who died of culture-positive sepsis from a known source and who had laboratory data available were evaluated for the presence of pPICS. Results: Among records extracted from the institutional database, 557 patients had culture-positive sepsis, with 262 patients having pPICS (47%). Patients with pPICS were more likely to have underlying hematologic or oncologic disease or cardiac disease. In addition, patients who had pPICS showed increased odds of associated fungal infection compared with those patients who did not (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.59-4.61; P < .001). When assessing laboratory criteria, having a sustained absolute lymphocyte count of < 1.0 × 103/$\mu$L was most closely associated with having pPICS compared with other laboratory parameters. Finally, the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that patients with pPICS were more common in the cardiac ICU, as opposed to the PICU (OR, 3.43; CI, 1.57-7.64; P = .002). Interpretation: Pediatric patients who died of a sepsis-related cause have a pPICS phenotype nearly one-half of the time. These patients are more likely to be in the cardiac ICU than the pediatric ICU and have associated fungal infections. Special attention should be directed toward this population in future research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To develop an outcome measure for patients with advanced cancer and their families which would cover more than either physical symptoms or quality of life related questions. To validate the measure in various specialist and non-specialist palliative care settings throughout the UK. DESIGN A systematic literature review of measures appropriate for use in palliative care settings was conducted. In conjunction with a multidisciplinary project advisory group, questions were chosen for inclusion into the scale based on whether they measured aspects of physical, psychological, or spiritual domains pertinent to palliative care, and whether similar items had shown to be valid as part of another measure. A staff completed version was developed to facilitate data collection on all patients throughout their care, and a patient completed version was designed to enable the patient to contribute to the assessment of their outcomes when possible. A full validation study was conducted to evaluate construct validity, internal consistency, responsiveness to change over time, and test-retest reliability. Assessments were timed. SETTING Eight centres in England and Scotland providing palliative care, including inpatient care, outpatient care, day care, home care, and primary care. PATIENTS A total of 450 patients entered care during the study period. Staff collected data routinely on patients in care long enough to be assessed (n = 337). Of these, 262 were eligible for patient participation; 148 (33%) went on to complete a questionnaire. MAIN MEASURES The Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS), the European Organisation for Research on Cancer Treatment, and the Support Team Assessment Schedule. RESULTS The POS consists of two almost identical measures, one of which is completed by staff, the other by patients. Agreement between staff and patient ratings was found to be acceptable for eight out of 10 items at the first assessment. The measure demonstrated construct validity (Spearman rho = 0.43 to 0.80). Test/re-test reliability was acceptable for seven items. Internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.65 (patients), 0.70 (staff)). Change over time was shown, but did not reach statistical significance. The questionnaire did not take more than 10 minutes to complete by staff or patients. CONCLUSION The POS has acceptable validity and reliability. It can be used to assess prospectively palliative care for patients with advanced cancer.},

abstract = {Purpose: Palliative care-related problems have not been measured in Africa in line with the WHO definition. This study aimed to measure the three-day period intensity of multidimensional problems (physical, psychological, social, and spiritual) among advanced cancer patients in Kenya and Uganda.
Methods: Adults with advanced malignant disease gave self-report data to the African Palliative Outcome Scale (POS).
Results: Among 210 respondents, more than half had an underlying HIV diagnosis (51.9 %). The worst ranked POS items were pain and information. In three multivariable ordinal logistic regression models with the 3 POS factors as dependent variables, for the first model (factor 1 physical and psychological well-being), as age increased, the well-being also improved (B = 0.022, p = 0.037), and as physical function score worsened, factor score also worsened (B = −0.685, p < 0.001). In the second model (factor 2 interpersonal well-being), a trend toward significance was found for gender, with being male predicting a higher (better) factor score (B = 0.502, p = 0.067). For the third model (factor 3 existential and spiritual), increasing age was predictive of higher (better) factor score (B = 0.023, p = 0.032), and worsening function was predictive of lower (worse) factor score (B = −0.543, p < 0.001).
Conclusions: This novel data revealed pain and information to plan for the future to affect patients most severely, underlining the importance of analgesia and social support. HIV infection did not affect the level of need. Our data suggest increasing need as function declines; therefore, home-based models with adequate family support are essential.},

abstract = {Objectives: To provide an appraisal of the evolving paradigms in the pathophysiology of sepsis and propose the evolution of a new phenotype of critically ill patients, its potential underlying mechanism, and its implications for the future of sepsis management and research. Design: Literature search using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Measurements and Main Results: Sepsis remains one of the most debilitating and expensive illnesses, and its prevalence is not declining. What is changing is our definition(s), its clinical course, and how we manage the septic patient. Once thought to be predominantly a syndrome of over exuberant inflammation, sepsis is now recognized as a syndrome of aberrant host protective immunity. Earlier recognition and compliance with treatment bundles has fortunately led to a decline in multiple organ failure and in-hospital mortality. Unfortunately, more and more sepsis patients, especially the aged, are suffering chronic critical illness, rarely fully recover, and often experience an indolent death. Patients with chronic critical illness often exhibit "a persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome," and it is proposed here that this state of persisting inflammation, immunosuppression and catabolism contributes to many of these adverse clinical outcomes. The underlying cause of inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome is currently unknown, but there is increasing evidence that altered myelopoiesis, reduced effector T-cell function, and expansion of immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells are all contributory. Conclusions: Although newer therapeutic interventions are targeting the inflammatory, the immunosuppressive, and the protein catabolic responses individually, successful treatment of the septic patient with chronic critical illness and persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome may require a more complementary approach.},

abstract = {Background: Medication errors and associated adverse drug events (ADE) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In recent years, the prevention of medication errors has become a high priority in healthcare systems. In order to improve medication safety, computerized Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are increasingly being integrated into the medication process. Accordingly, a growing number of studies have investigated the medication safety-related effectiveness of CDSS. However, the outcome measures used are heterogeneous, leading to unclear evidence. The primary aim of this study is to summarize and categorize the outcomes used in interventional studies evaluating the effects of CDSS on medication safety in primary and long-term care. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library for interventional studies evaluating the effects of CDSS targeting medication safety and patient-related outcomes. We extracted methodological characteristics, outcomes and empirical findings from the included studies. Outcomes were assigned to three main categories: process-related, harm-related, and cost-related. Risk of bias was assessed using the Evidence Project risk of bias tool. Results: Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Almost all studies (n = 31) used process-related outcomes, followed by harm-related outcomes (n = 11). Only three studies used cost-related outcomes. Most studies used outcomes from only one category and no study used outcomes from all three categories. The definition and operationalization of outcomes varied widely between the included studies, even within outcome categories. Overall, evidence on CDSS effectiveness was mixed. A significant intervention effect was demonstrated by nine of fifteen studies with process-related primary outcomes (60%) but only one out of five studies with harm-related primary outcomes (20%). The included studies faced a number of methodological problems that limit the comparability and generalizability of their results. Conclusions: Evidence on the effectiveness of CDSS is currently inconclusive due in part to inconsistent outcome definitions and methodological problems in the literature. Additional high-quality studies are therefore needed to provide a comprehensive account of CDSS effectiveness. These studies should follow established methodological guidelines and recommendations and use a comprehensive set of harm-, process- and cost-related outcomes with agreed-upon and consistent definitions.

It is a common cause of intestinal failure. This review seeks to summarize the scope of disease burden, review comorbidities, and emphasize current and evolving treatment strategies. Recent findings: The implementation of multidisciplinary intestinal rehabilitation programs has improved patient outcomes. Lipid minimization and availability of alternative lipid emulsions, such as Omegaven and SMOFlipid, have been important to reducing intestinal failure–associated liver disease. Teduglutide, an analog of glucagon-like peptide 2, promotes intestinal adaptation and holds a promising future as an emerging treatment option. Summary: Management is nuanced and complex with considerations related to nutrition, growth, liver health, vascular integrity, bone health, infectious risks, neurodevelopment, and quality of life. New opportunities for collaborative, prospective, multisite research are emerging with the widespread application of electronic medical records and the possibility of integrated multicenter databases. Ongoing research efforts seek to further optimize intestinal adaptation through pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic means.},

abstract = {Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a rare disorder with known physical, psychosocial, and economic burdens and significant morbidity and mortality. Many individuals with SBS require long-term home parenteral nutrition (HPN). The incidence and prevalence of SBS is difficult to determine because it is often based on HPN usage and may not account for those who receive intravenous fluids or achieve enteral autonomy. The most common etiologies associated with SBS are Crohn's disease and mesenteric ischemia. Intestinal anatomy and remnant bowel length are prognostic for HPN dependency, and enteral autonomy confers a survival advantage. Health economic data confirm that PN-related costs are higher for hospitalizations than at home; yet significant healthcare resource utilization is necessary for successful HPN, and patients and families report substantial financial distress that impacts quality of life (QOL). An important advancement in QOL measurement is the validation of HPN- and SBS-specific QOL questionnaires. In addition to the known factors negatively impacting QOL, such as diarrhea, pain, nocturia, fatigue, depression, and narcotic dependency, research has shown that the volume and number of PN infusions per week is associated with QOL. Although traditional QOL measurements describe how underlying disease and therapy influence life, they do not assess how symptoms and functional limitations affect the QOL of patients and caregivers. Patient-centered measures and conversation focused on psychosocial issues helps patients with SBS and HPN dependency better cope with their disease and treatment. This article presents a brief overview of SBS, including epidemiology, survival, costs, and QOL.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether scores in an adapted version of the self-assessment Pubertal Development Scale into Portuguese match those from the gold standard in pubertal development (Tanner scale). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with a convenience sample of 133 children and adolescents aged nine to 17 years (59 males; mean age of 13 years and six months, with standard deviation = 25 months). Youngsters completed the Pubertal Development Scale and were then examined by specialists in adolescent medicine. RESULTS: Exact absolute agreement of pubertal stages were modest, but significant associations between measures (correlation; intra-class correlation coefficients of consistency) showed that the Pubertal Development Scale adequately measures changes that map onto pubertal development determined by physical examination, on par with international publications. Furthermore, scores obtained from each Pubertal Development Scale question reflected adequate gonadal and adrenal events assessed by clinical ratings, mostly with medium/high effect sizes. Latent factors obtained from scores on all Pubertal Development Scale questions had excellent fit indices in Confirmatory Factor Analyses and correlated with Tanner staging. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that self-assessment of body changes by youngsters using the Portuguese version of the Pubertal Development Scale is useful when estimates of pubertal progression are sufficient, and exact agreement with clinical staging is not necessary. The Pubertal Development Scale is, therefore, a reliable instrument for use in large-scale studies in Brazil that aim at investigating adolescent health related to pubertal developmental. The translated version and scoring systems are provided. DESCRIPTORS: Adolescent Development. Puberty. Surveys and Questionnaires. Translations. Reproducibility of Results.},

abstract = {Background. Childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity are related to health risks, medical conditions, and increased risk of adult obesity, with its attendant effects on morbidity and mortality rates. The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity has more than doubled in the past 25 years. Purpose. This evidence synthesis examines the evidence for the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment of overweight among children and adolescents in clinical settings. Methods. We developed an analytic framework and 7 key questions representing the logical evidence connecting screening and weight control interventions with changes in overweight and behavioral, physiologic, and health outcomes in childhood or adulthood. We searched the Cochrane Library from 1996 to April 2004. We searched Medline, PsycINFO, DARE, and CINAHL from 1966 to April 2004. One reviewer abstracted relevant information from each included article into standardized evidence tables, and a second reviewer checked key elements. Two reviewers quality-graded each article with US Preventive Services Task Force criteria. Results. Although BMI is a measure of relative weight rather than adiposity, it is recommended widely for use among children and adolescents to determine overweight and is the currently preferred measure. The risk of adult overweight from childhood overweight provides the best available evidence to judge the clinical validity of BMI as an overweight criterion for children and adolescents. BMI measures in childhood track to adulthood moderately or very well, with stronger tracking seen for children with &ge;1 obese parent and children who are more overweight or older. The probability of adult obesity (BMI of >30 kg/m2) is &ge;50% among children >13 years of age whose BMI percentiles meet or exceed the 95th percentile for age and gender. BMI-based overweight categorization for individuals, particularly for racial/ethnic minorities with differences in body composition, may have limited validity because BMI measures cannot differentiate between increased weight for height attributable to relatively greater fat-free mass (muscle, bone, and fluids) and that attributable to greater fat. No trials of screening programs to identify and to treat childhood overweight have been reported. Limited research is available on effective, generalizable interventions for overweight children and adolescents that can be conducted in primary care settings or through primary care referrals. Conclusions. BMI measurements of overweight among older adolescents identify those at increased risk of developing adult obesity. Interventions to treat overweight adolescents in clinical settings have not been shown to have clinically significant benefits, and they are not widely available. Screening to categorize overweight among children under age 12 or 13 who are not clearly overweight may not provide reliable risk categorization for adult obesity. Screening in this age group is compromised by the fact that there is little generalizable evidence for primary care interventions. Because existing trials report modest short- to medium-term improvements (∼10-20% decrease in percentage of overweight or a few units of change in BMI), however, overweight improvements among children and adolescents seem possible.},

Participants in the Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto (1978/1979 and 1994), Pelotas (1982, 1993 and 2004) and S{\~{a}}o Lu{\'{i}}s (1997/1998) birth cohorts were included in different follow-ups from 7 years old onwards. Excess weight (overweight and obesity) were assessed by body mass index. The highest prevalences were observed in Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto (excess weight: 27.7% at 9-11 and 47.1% at 22-23 years; obesity: 8.6% at 9-11 and 19.8% at 22-23 years) while the smallest was in S{\~{a}}o Lu{\'{i}}s (excess weight: 5.4 to 7-9 and 17.2% at 18-19 years; obesity: 1.8% at 7-9 and 3.6% at 18-19 years). The younger the cohort, the greater the prevalence of excess weight and obesity when comparing similar age groups. Increases in obesity prevalence were greater than in excess weight prevalence. Women had lower excess weight prevalence in older cohorts and higher obesity prevalence in younger cohorts. Higher excess weight and obesity prevalence were observed in higher income children and adolescents, and in poorer adults. Differences in the prevalence of excess weight and obesity evidenced that individuals from younger cohorts are more exposed to this morbidity, as well as those who were born in the most developed city, low-income adults as well as children and adolescents belonging to families of the highest income tertile. Therefore, the results of this study indicate the need to prioritize actions aimed at younger individuals.},

abstract = {Background: The excess adiposity, even in the absence of diseases, is responsible for a decline in pulmonary function, which is considered a predictor of mortality and a risk factor for diseases in several epidemiological studies. However, studies on the association between obesity and pulmonary function have found only few associations or inconclusive results. The aim of the study is to evaluate the association between body composition and spirometric parameters, comparing simple obesity measures such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference with more precise body composition measurements such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and air-displacement plethysmography (BOD POD). Methods: This is an observational, cross-sectional study that used data from the 1978/79 Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto birth cohort (S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil). The study included 1746 participants from the 5th follow-up of the cohort. Linear regressions were calculated to evaluate the association between BMI, waist circumference, waist–height ratio (WHtR), BOD POD- and DXA-measured fat mass percentage, and spirometric parameters FEV1, and FVC. Results: For every 1-kg/m2 BMI increase, FVC decreased by 13 ml in males and by 6 ml in females and FEV1 decreased by 11 ml and 5 ml, respectively. Regarding body composition measurements, for a 1% increase in fat mass assessed by BOD POD, FVC decreased by 16 ml in males and by 8 ml in females and FEV1 decreased by 13 ml and 7 ml, respectively. Hence, negative associations between body measurements and FEV1 and FVC were observed in both genders, especially when using the fat mass measurement and were more expressive in men. Conclusion: The anthropometric and body composition parameters were negatively associated with the spirometric variables FVC and FEV1. We have also observed that simple measures such as waist-height ratio were sufficient to detect the association of body composition with pulmonary function reduction.},

Common thematic axes are identified and the objectives, baseline periods, follow-up stages and representativity of the population studied are presented. The Consortium includes three birth cohorts from Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto, S{\~{a}}o Paulo State (1978/1979, 1994 and 2010), four from Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State (1982, 1993, 2004 and 2015), and two from S{\~{a}}o Lu{\'{i}}s, Maranh{\~{a}}o State (1997 and 2010). The cohorts cover three regions of Brazil, from three distinct states, with marked socioeconomic, cultural and infrastructure differences. The cohorts were started at birth, except for the most recent one in each municipality, where mothers were recruited during pregnancy. The instruments for data collection have been refined in order to approach different exposures during the early phases of life and their long-term influence on the health-disease process. The investigators of the nine cohorts carried out perinatal studies and later studied human capital, mental health, nutrition and precursor signs of noncommunicable diseases. A total of 17,636 liveborns were recruited in Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto, 19,669 in Pelotas, and 7,659 in S{\~{a}}o Lu{\'{i}}s. In the studies starting during pregnancy, 1,400 pregnant women were interviewed in Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto, 3,199 in Pelotas, and 1,447 in S{\~{a}}o Lu{\'{i}}s. Different strategies were employed to reduce losses to follow-up. This research network allows the analysis of the incidence of diseases and the establishment of possible causal relations that might explain the health outcomes of these populations in order to contribute to the development of governmental actions and health policies more consistent with reality.},

abstract = {Background: Few studies have assessed dietary patterns (DPs) and the changes in these patterns over time in adults. The present study aimed to investigate whether possible changes in DPs in two assessments are associated with obesity and excess body fat. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in which data were collected from 1082 adults of a Brazilian birth cohort during two periods 15 years apart (T1: 2002–2004; T2: 2016–2017). Food consumption was assessed in both periods using validated food frequency questionnaires. Three similar DPs were found in the two assessments, and adherence to these patterns was classified as prudent, risk or mixed. Nine DPs changes were defined. At T2, subjects with a body mass index ≥ 30.0 kg m–² were classified as obese, and men and women with a body fat (BF) percentage ≥ 25.0 and ≥ 35.0, respectively, were classified as having excess BF. A directed acyclic graph was built to adjust the association for confounding variables. Results: At T2, 34.4% of the subjects were obese and 61.4% had excess BF. In the adjusted analysis, the changes associated with obesity and excess BF were prudent–mixed (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–2.29 and PR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.10–1.65), risk–risk (PR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.03–2.13 and PR = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.04–1.53), risk–mixed (PR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.05–2.31 and PR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.07–1.63) and mixed–risk (PR = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.10–2.35 and PR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.04–1.58). Conclusions: A decline in food quality over time or stagnation in an unhealthy DP can lead to obesity and excess BF.},

Therefore, it is essential to evaluate anthropometric and body composition indicators used for its diagnosis. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of body fat percentage (BF%), fat mass index (FMI) and body mass index (BMI) for detecting cardiometabolic outcomes in adults. A cross-sectional study was conducted involving adults at 30 years of age from Pelotas, RS (n = 3517) and at 37–39 years from Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto, SP (n = 1696). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the cut-off points for predicting cardiometabolic risk factors, including altered blood pressure, blood glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDDL-c), C-reactive protein and glycated hemoglobin. The cut-off points of BF% ranged from 25.2 to 27.8 in men and from 37.4 to 39.7 in women at 30 years, and from 26.1 to 27.8 in men and from 38.5 to 42.2 in women at 37–39 years. For FMI (kg/m2), the cut-off points ranged from 6.3 to 7.5 in men and from 9.5 to 10.8 in women at 30 years, and from 7.3 to 7.8 in men and from 10.2 to 12.2 in women at 37–39 years. The BMI cut-off points (kg/m2) ranged from 26.3 to 27.3 in men and from 25.4 to 27.2 in women at 30 years, and from 28.3 to 29.0 in men and from 27.2 to 29.6 in women at 37–39 years. The areas under the curve were similar for the three indicators, ranging from 0.523 to 0.746. BMI showed a performance similar to that of the body fat-based indicators in identifying cardiometabolic outcomes. The cut-off points of the three indicators showed acceptable discriminatory power in subjects with cardiometabolic risk factors.},

A coorte BRISA foi iniciada em 2010, com o objetivo de acompanhar, ao longo de v{\'{a}}rias etapas da vida, crian{\c{c}}as nascidas nesse ano nas cidades de Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto/SP e S{\~{a}}o Lu{\'{i}}s/MA. O BRISA se subdivide em dois grandes projetos: o BRISA pr{\'{e}}-natal e o BRISA nascimento. Vamos apresentar a seguir a coorte BRISA Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto. Objetivos do BRISA O principal objetivo do BRISA {\'{e}} estudar fatores de risco para o nascimento pr{\'{e}}-termo (antes de 37 semanas de gesta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o) e suas consequ{\^{e}}ncias ao longo da vida. Para isso, hip{\'{o}}teses que relacionam altera{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es em alguns sistemas do organismo materno que funcionam de modo altamente interligado (como o sistema neurol{\'{o}}gico e o endocrinol{\'{o}}gico) e que podem repercutir na sa{\'{u}}de do feto levando ao nascimento pr{\'{e}}-termo foram testadas. Essas altera{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es foram tamb{\'{e}}m avaliadas em associa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com uma s{\'{e}}rie de condi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es durante a gesta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, como viol{\^{e}}ncia dom{\'{e}}stica e familiar, experi{\^{e}}ncia de discrimina{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o racial, presen{\c{c}}a de estresse na gesta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, infec{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es maternas, infec{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o bucal materna, n{\'{i}}veis de algumas prote{\'{i}}nas liberadas no sangue da m{\~{a}}e e varia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es em genes da m{\~{a}}e que podem desencadear parto pr{\'{e}}-termo. Isso tudo foi avaliado na coorte do pr{\'{e}}-natal. Na coorte do nascimento, foram estimadas as taxas de baixo peso ao nascer, nascimento pr{\'{e}}-termo e restri{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de crescimento intrauterino e da mortalidade infantil, com o intuito de realizar compara{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es com as coortes anteriores estudadas em Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto (1978/79 e 1994) e avaliar os fatores associados a essas condi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es. Al{\'{e}}m disso, estimou-se a preval{\^{e}}ncia de infec{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o cong{\^{e}}nita por citomegalov{\'{i}}rus (CMV), um v{\'{i}}rus muito comum na popula{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e que pode causar algumas manifesta{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es em rec{\'{e}}m-nascidos, como dificuldade de audi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. No seguimento dessas coortes, realizado ap{\'{o}}s um ano de vida, os objetivos foram avaliar as repercuss{\~{o}}es das condi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de nascimento sobre as caracter{\'{i}}sticas da sa{\'{u}}de geral dessas crian{\c{c}}as, tais como asma, alergia, obesidade, interna{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es hospitalares, c{\'{a}}ries dent{\'{a}}rias, neurodesenvolvimento, entre outros. – BRISA Pr{\'{e}}-Natal O “BRISA Pr{\'{e}}-Natal” em Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto foi iniciado em fevereiro de 2010 e contou com a participa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de 1400 gestantes, entre a 22{\textordfeminine} e 25{\textordfeminine} semana de gesta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. Nesta fase foram realizadas as seguintes avalia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es: aplica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de question{\'{a}}rios sociodemogr{\'{a}}ficos, question{\'{a}}rios sobre aspectos psicol{\'{o}}gicos, sociais e relativos a sa{\'{u}}de em geral, coleta de amostra de sangue e material vaginal, ultrassonografia, medida de peso e altura e exame odontol{\'{o}}gico. Com os dados obtidos foi poss{\'{i}}vel caracterizar a popula{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o estudada e realizar avalia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de alguns aspectos da sa{\'{u}}de da gestante e fatores de risco para o nascimento pr{\'{e}}-termo. As crian{\c{c}}as do BRISA Pr{\'{e}}-Natal de Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto nasceram entre abril de 2010 e junho de 2011. Nessa ocasi{\~{a}}o, foram coletadas informa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es do nascimento (por meio de consulta aos prontu{\'{a}}rios) de 1370 crian{\c{c}}as ainda na maternidade. Ap{\'{o}}s as crian{\c{c}}as completarem 13 meses de idade, de 2011 a 2013, foi realizado o primeiro seguimento das crian{\c{c}}as, tendo participado desta etapa 1007 crian{\c{c}}as. Nesta ocasi{\~{a}}o foram aplicados question{\'{a}}rios com a m{\~{a}}e/respons{\'{a}}vel relativos {\`{a}} sa{\'{u}}de mental, h{\'{a}}bitos de vida e m{\'{e}}todos de contracep{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, question{\'{a}}rios sobre a alimenta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e sa{\'{u}}de geral das crian{\c{c}}as, coletado sangue da crian{\c{c}}a, realizado exame odontol{\'{o}}gico e avalia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es sobre o desenvolvimento infantil (Escalas Bayley), al{\'{e}}m de medidas de peso e altura e coleta de informa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es socioecon{\^{o}}micas e demogr{\'{a}}ficas. – BRISA Nascimento Em 2010, iniciou-se o “BRISA Nascimento”: entre 1{\textordmasculine} de janeiro e 31 de dezembro de 2010, durante todos os dias, todas as maternidades de Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto foram visitadas e todas as m{\~{a}}es convidadas a participarem do estudo. Nesta fase, foi registrada a participa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de 7752 crian{\c{c}}as. A coorte de nascimento identificou os nascimentos hospitalares que ocorreram em todos os servi{\c{c}}os de maternidade, p{\'{u}}blicos ou privados. Ap{\'{o}}s as crian{\c{c}}as completarem 13 meses, parte das m{\~{a}}es foram convidadas a participar de uma nova etapa do BRISA, de reavalia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o das crian{\c{c}}as (etapa do seguimento). Em Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto foram avaliadas nesta ocasi{\~{a}}o 4182 crian{\c{c}}as da coorte de nascimento, tendo sido feitas as mesmas avalia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es realizadas no pr{\'{e}}-natal. Atualiza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de Contatos No per{\'{i}}odo de mar{\c{c}}o a julho de 2020 foi realizada a atualiza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e confirma{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de contatos das m{\~{a}}es e familiares. Nesse per{\'{i}}odo, foi realizada uma busca ativa de todas as m{\~{a}}es participantes de alguma etapa anterior do BRISA. Dessa forma, foi poss{\'{i}}vel garantir maior agilidade no agendamento das avalia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es das crian{\c{c}}as do BRISA para a etapa seguinte, a Fase Escolar. Para atualiza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, a equipe entrou em contato com milhares de m{\~{a}}es pelo WhatsApp, telefone fixo e redes sociais. O in{\'{i}}cio das avalia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es da etapa Fase escolar estava previsto para fevereiro de 2020, no entanto, devido {\`{a}} pandemia da COVID-19, o contato presencial com as crian{\c{c}}as e respons{\'{a}}veis foi temporariamente suspenso. Enquanto as avalia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es presenciais n{\~{a}}o foram poss{\'{i}}veis, o Projeto realizou duas avalia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es online, BRISA WhatsApp e BRISA WEB. O BRISA WhatsApp avaliou por meio de question{\'{a}}rios aplicados via WhatsApp entre os meses de agosto e novembro de 2020. Os question{\'{a}}rios avaliaram o bem-estar de m{\~{a}}es e crian{\c{c}}as durante o per{\'{i}}odo de maior isolamento social. No total, 461 fam{\'{i}}lias participaram desta avalia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. O BRISA Web avaliou como a pandemia afetou a vida das crian{\c{c}}as por meio de entrevistas de aproximadamente 30 minutos realizadas por liga{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o telef{\^{o}}nica ou Google Meet. No total, 1033 fam{\'{i}}lias foram entrevistadas. {\'{U}}LTIMA ETAPA DE AVALIA{\c{C}}{\~{O}}ES: BRISA FASE ESCOLAR Neste ano, a coorte BRISA finalizou suas avalia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es da etapa de acompanhamento chamada fase escolar. As avalia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es iniciaram efetivamente em mar{\c{c}}o de 2022 e foram finalizadas em julho de 2023. Nesta etapa, aos 11-13 anos, os adolescentes que nasceram entre janeiro de 2010 e junho de 2011 em Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto realizaram exames e avalia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de sa{\'{u}}de geral e bucal (TOTALMENTE GRATUITOS!), realizados no pr{\'{e}}dio da Unidade de Pesquisa Cl{\'{i}}nica do Hospital das Cl{\'{i}}nicas da FMRP/USP (localizado na Rua Tenente Cat{\~{a}}o Roxo, 2701 – pr{\'{o}}ximo ao HC Campus). Os participantes tiveram direito a realiza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de avalia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es com equipes de nutricionistas, dentistas, fisioterapeutas e psic{\'{o}}logos. Foram realizadas an{\'{a}}lises de composi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o corporal (percentual de gordura e massa {\'{o}}ssea), antropometria (medidas de peso, altura, circunfer{\^{e}}ncias), question{\'{a}}rios de sa{\'{u}}de mental e consumo alimentar, al{\'{e}}m de investiga{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es sobre a sa{\'{u}}de respirat{\'{o}}ria, for{\c{c}}a muscular, qualidade do sono, press{\~{a}}o arterial e sa{\'{u}}de dos vasos sangu{\'{i}}neos. No total, 3263 adolescentes participaram presencialmente da coorte BRISA na fase escolar! Import{\^{a}}ncia do BRISA Todas as fases da coorte BRISA contribu{\'{i}}ram e continuam contribuindo muito com o avan{\c{c}}o do conhecimento sobre nossa popula{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e condi{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de sa{\'{u}}de. V{\'{a}}rios resultados j{\'{a}} foram publicados, outros est{\~{a}}o em an{\'{a}}lise e mais dados futuramente ser{\~{a}}o utilizados para compara{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es com os resultados da atual etapa “BRISA Fase Escolar”. Al{\'{e}}m da publica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de trabalhos em revistas cient{\'{i}}ficas com resultados encontrados no BRISA, estamos divulgando informa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es muito importantes deste estudo para a popula{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, por meio de nossas m{\'{i}}dias sociais (Facebook e Instagram). Sigam nossas p{\'{a}}ginas e saibam como sua participa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o tem sido fundamental para o estudo da sa{\'{u}}de de nossas crian{\c{c}}as. O estudo se prop{\~{o}}e a investigar poss{\'{i}}veis fatores associados ao crescimento e desenvolvimento das crian{\c{c}}as da coorte BRISA, explorando e utilizando instrumentos e medidas de indicadores de desenvolvimento de doen{\c{c}}as cr{\^{o}}nicas ainda pouco utilizados e investigados em crian{\c{c}}as na idade escolar. O BRISA pretende ainda investigar aspectos comportamentais e de transtornos do neurodesenvolvimento associados aos h{\'{a}}bitos de vida da gestante no per{\'{i}}odo pr{\'{e}}-natal, da crian{\c{c}}a no in{\'{i}}cio da vida e no presente. Ningu{\'{e}}m esperava por isso, mas enquanto est{\'{a}}vamos preparando o Projeto “BRISA Fase Escolar” para ir a campo nesta nova etapa, aconteceu a pandemia causada pelo novo coronav{\'{i}}rus, chamado SARS-Cov-2, que causa a doen{\c{c}}a do coronav{\'{i}}rus, chamada COVID-19 . Essa pandemia causou e tem causado um grande impacto na vida de todos n{\'{o}}s, interferindo nas atividades di{\'{a}}rias, no emprego, na sa{\'{u}}de e na perda de entes queridos em algumas fam{\'{i}}lias. As crian{\c{c}}as tiveram que se afastar da escola e muitas n{\~{a}}o puderam ter contato com seus amigos e com parentes queridos, como tios e av{\'{o}}s. Devido a isso, naquele per{\'{i}}odo, prorrogamos o in{\'{i}}cio da fase escolar. Quando tudo se acalmou, retomamos as atividades do projeto e tamb{\'{e}}m procuramos avaliar como essa pandemia influenciou o bem estar das crian{\c{c}}as e das fam{\'{i}}lias do BRISA. Assim, ser{\'{a}} poss{\'{i}}vel formular propostas para lidar com esses problemas. Mais um motivo pelo qual a participa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de voc{\^{e}}s continua sendo muito importante!},

abstract = {Purpose: To examine the relationship of early persistent lymphopenia with hospital survival in critically ill patients with and without sepsis to assess whether it can be considered a treatable trait. Methods: Retrospective database analysis of patients with nonelective admission to intensive care units (ICUs) during January 2015 to December 2018. Patients were classified as having sepsis if the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III admission diagnostic code included sepsis or coded for an infection combined with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of ≥2. We defined early persistent lymphopenia at two thresholds (absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] <1.0 and <0.75 × 109/L) based on two qualifying values recorded during the first 4 days in ICU. The main outcome measure was time to in-hospital death. Results: Of 8,507 eligible patients, 7,605 (89.4%) had two ALCs recorded during their first 4 days in ICU; of these, 1,482 (19.5%) had sepsis. Persistent lymphopenia (ALC <1.0) was present in 728 of 1,482 (49.1%) and 2,302 of 6,123 (37.6%) patients with and without sepsis, respectively. For ALC <0.75, the results were 487 of 1,482 (32.9%) and 1,125 of 6,123 (18.4%), respectively. Of 3,030 patients with persistent lymphopenia (ALC <1.0), 562 (18.5%) died compared with 439 of 4,575 (9.6%) without persistent lymphopenia. Persistent lymphopenia was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death in all patients. The hazard ratios for death at ALC <1.0 were 1.89 (95% confidence interval, 1.32–2.71; P = 0.0005) and 1.17 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.35; P = 0.0246) in patients with and without sepsis respectively. Conclusions: Early persistent lymphopenia is common in critically ill patients and associated with increased risk of death in patients with and without sepsis. Although the association is stronger in patients with sepsis, lymphopenia is a candidate to be considered a treatable trait; drugs that reverse lymphopenia should be trialed in critically ill patients.},

They are present in cancer patients as well as in patients with severe inflammatory conditions and infections. MDSCs exist as two main subtypes, the granulocytic (G-MDSCs) and the monocytic (Mo-MDSCs) type, as defined by their surface phenotype and functions. While the functions of MDSCs have been investigated in depth, the origin of human MDSCs is less characterized and even controversial. In this review, we recapitulate theories on how MDSCs are generated in mice, and whether this knowledge is translatable into human MDSC biology, as well as on problems of defining MDSCs by their immature cell surface phenotype in relation to the plasticity of myeloid cells. Finally, the challenge of pharmacological targeting of MDSCs in the future is envisioned.},

@article{Chen2022,
abstract = {Background: Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PIICS) is associated with high mortality and high health care costs, and there is currently no effective target treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess multipotent immunomodulatory properties. LPS-preconditioned type 1 MSCs (MSC1s) are potentially beneficial for PIICS treatment because of their proinflammatory, anti-infective, and healing properties. Here, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of action of MSC1s in PIICS. Methods: We previously optimized a reaggravated PIICS mouse model, which was used in this study. PIICS mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture on day 1 and LPS injection on day 11. Subsequently, the mice were treated with or without MSC1s. Animal survival and phenotypes, along with the levels of catabolism, inflammation, and immunosuppression, were evaluated. MSC1s were cocultured with CD8+ T cells in vitro, and inflammatory cytokine levels and CD8+ T-cell function were assessed. Results: MSC1 transplantation alleviated weight loss and muscle wasting, inhibited catabolism and inflammation, and considerably improved the proportion and function of CD8+ T cells in the PIICS mice. After coculture with MSC1s, the expression levels of CD107a and interferon $\gamma$ increased, whereas the expression level of programmed death 1 decreased significantly in CD8+ T cells. MSC1s also promoted proinflammatory cytokine secretion and reduced the concentration of soluble PD-L1 in vitro. Conclusions: MSC1s can protect mice against critical PIICS, partly by enhancing CD8+ T-cell function. Therefore, MSC1 transplantation is a novel therapeutic candidate for PIICS.},

We examined the efficacy of antithrombin, which may attenuate coagulopathy with the control of inflammation, for PICS among patients with sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The present study used the inpatient claims database with laboratory findings to identify patients admitted to intensive care units and diagnosed with sepsis and DIC. A composite of the incidence of PICS on day 14 or 14-day mortality as the primary outcome was compared between the antithrombin and control groups using a propensity-score-matched analysis. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of PICS on day 28, 28-day mortality, and in-hospital mortality. A total of 324 well-balanced matched pairs were generated from 1622 patients. The primary outcome did not differ between the antithrombin and control groups (63.9% vs. 68.2%, respectively, p = 0.245). However, the incidences of 28-day and in-hospital mortality were significantly lower in the antithrombin group (16.0% vs. 23.5% and 24.4% vs. 35.8%, respectively). Similar results were obtained in a sensitivity analysis using overlap weighting. Antithrombin did not reduce the occurrence of PICS on day 14 in patients with sepsis-induced DIC; however, it was associated with a better mid-term (day 28) prognosis.},

abstract = {Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PIICS) is a growing challenge in intensive care units (ICUs). PIICS causes a severe illness with high mortality. Currently, treatment is expensive, and the outcomes are dismal. Herein, we established a PIICS model to study the disease pathophysiology and its potential treatment. Using a modified sublethal cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis (day 1) and the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an aggravated inflammation response (day 11), CLP + LPS mice recapitulating PIICS features were successfully generated (day 14). Adult male mice were divided into CLP + LPS, CLP + daily chronic stress (DCS), CLP, DCS, LPS, and sham control groups. A survival curve was generated, and phenotypes were analyzed using markers for catabolism, inflammation, and immunosuppression. The CLP + LPS model showed two mortality peaks (after CLP and after LPS), whereas the CLP + DCS and CLP groups showed one peak. Surviving CLP + LPS mice exhibited significantly increased catabolism and inflammatory cytokine levels and aggravated inflammation, including organ inflammation. CLP + LPS mice exhibited strong immune suppression as evidenced by decreased splenic cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ and interferon-g+CD8+ T cell counts and a concomitant and significant increase in the myeloid-derived suppressor cell population. This CLPþLPS-induced PIICS model differs from acute sepsis models, showing two mortality peaks and a protracted course of 14 days. Compared to previous PIICS models, ours shows a re-aggravated status and higher catabolism, inflammation, and immunosuppression levels. Our aim was to use the PIICS model to simulate PIICS pathophysiology and course in the ICU, enabling investigation of its mechanism and treatment.},

Alpinetin is a flavonoid isolated from Alpinia katsumadai Hayata that has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the administration of alpinetin could attenuate PICS in a septic mouse model. Mice were randomly divided into four groups: the (1) sham-operated group, (2) sham+alpinetin (1 mg/kg intravenously infused for once per day after sham operation), (3) cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and (4) CLP+alpinetin (50 mg/kg intravenously infused for once per day after CLP). Eight days after sham operation or CLP surgery, mice were euthanized for subsequent examination. Alpinetin significantly improved the survival of septic mice. Also, it attenuated the CLP-induced persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome. The level of plasma proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis of T lymphocytes were obviously decreased by alpinetin as well. Moreover, oxidative stress in the organs was compelling lower in the alpinetin-treated CLP mice. In this clinically relevant model of sepsis, alpinetin ameliorates CLP-induced organ dysfunction and improves the likelihood of survival, possibly through suppressing the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. These findings suggested that alpinetin could be a potential novel therapeutic approach to prevent sepsis-induced PICS.},

abstract = {Background: Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PIICS) is known as a prolonged immunodeficiency that occurs after severe infection. Few studies have demonstrated a direct relationship between PIICS and physical dysfunction in post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). We herein investigated how each component of PICS was affected by the diagnosis of PIICS during hospitalization and examined the relationship between PIICS and PICS using PICS assessments performed at the Hitachi General Hospital PICS Clinic. Methods: The 273 patients who visited the PICS clinic at one month after discharge from the ICU at Hitachi General Hospital were included in the study. We used the diagnostic criteria for PIICS described in previous studies. At least two of the following blood test values on day 14 of hospitalization had to be met for a diagnosis of PIICS: C-reactive protein (CRP) > 2.0 mg/dL, albumin (Alb) < 3.0 g/dL, and lymphocytes (Lym) < 800/$\mu$L. Blood test values closest to day 14 out of 11–17 days of hospitalization were used. The primary outcome was a Barthel Index (BI) < 90, while secondary outcomes were the results of various PICS assessments, including mental and cognitive impairments, performed at the PICS clinic. We supplemented missing data with multiple imputations by chained equations. We performed a nominal logistic regression analysis with age, sex, BMI, SOFA, and the presence of PIICS as variables for BI < 90. Results: Forty-three out of two hundred seventy-three PICS outpatients met the diagnostic criteria for PIICS during hospitalization. In comparisons with non-PIICS patients, significantly higher severity scores for APACHE II and SOFA and a longer hospital stay were observed in PIICS patients, suggesting a higher clinical severity. The primary outcome, BI, was lower in the PIICS group (97.5 (58.5, 100) vs. 100 (95, 100), p = 0.008), as were the secondary outcomes (FSS-ICU: 35 (31, 35) vs. 35 (35, 35), MRC score: 55 (50.25, 58) vs. 58 (53, 60), grip strength: 16.45 (9.2, 25.47) vs. 20.4 (15.3, 27.7)). No significant differences were noted in mental or cognitive function assessments, such as HADS, IES-R, and SMQ. A multivariable analysis supplemented with missing data revealed that PIICS (odds ratio: 1.23 (1.08–1.40 p = 0.001) and age (odds ratio: 1.007 (1.004–1.01), p < 0.001) correlated with BI < 90, independent of clinical severity such as sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA). Similar results were obtained in the sensitivity analysis excluding missing data. Conclusions: The present study revealed a strong relationship between PIICS and post-discharge PICS physical dysfunction in patients requiring intensive care.},

abstract = {Background:Older adults have worse outcomes after sepsis than young adults. Additionally, alterations of the gut microbiota have been demonstrated to contribute to sepsis-related mortality. We sought to determine if there were alterations in the gut microbiota with a novel sepsis model in old adult mice, which enter a state of persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism (PICS), as compared with young adult mice, which recover with the sepsis model.Methods:Mixed sex old (∼20 mo) and young (∼4 mo) C57Bl/6J mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture with daily chronic stress (CLP+DCS) and were compared with naive age-matched controls. Mice were sacrificed at CLP+DCS day 7 and feces collected for bacterial DNA isolation. The V3-V4 hypervariable region was amplified, 16S rRNA gene sequencing performed, and cohorts compared. $\alpha$-Diversity was assessed using Chao1 and Shannon indices using rarefied counts, and $\beta$-diversity was assessed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.Results:Naive old adult mice had significantly different $\alpha$ and $\beta$-diversity compared with naive adult young adult mice. After CLP+DCS, there was a significant shift in the $\alpha$ and $\beta$-diversity (FDR = 0.03 for both) of old adult mice (naive vs. CLP+DCS). However, no significant shift was displayed in the microbiota of young mice that underwent CLP+DCS in regards to $\alpha$-diversity (FDR = 0.052) and $\beta$-diversity (FDR = 0.12), demonstrating a greater overall stability of their microbiota at 7 days despite the septic insult. The taxonomic changes in old mice undergoing CLP+DCS were dominated by decreased abundance of the order Clostridiales and genera Oscillospira.Conclusion:Young adult mice maintain an overall microbiome stability 7 days after CLP+DCS after compared with old adult mice. The lack of microbiome stability could contribute to PICS and worse long-term outcomes in older adult sepsis survivors. Further studies are warranted to elucidate mechanistic pathways and potential therapeutics.},

abstract = {Many patients in intensive care units, especially the elderly, suffer from chronic critical illness and exhibit a new pathophysiological phenotype: persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS). Most patients with PICS have a constellation of digestive-system symptoms and gut failure. Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk) is a commensal gut bacterium that reduces inflammation, balances immune responses, modulates energy metabolism, and supports gut health. This study investigated the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of live and pasteurized Akk in treating PICS in a mouse model. PICS was induced on day 14 after performing cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) on day 1 and administrating lipopolysaccharide on day 11. Pasteurized or live Akk, or phosphate-buffered saline was administered twice daily by oral gavage for 7 days. Both live and pasteurized Akk attenuated PICS, as evidenced by reduced weight loss, and a reduction in symptoms and serum cytokine/chemokine levels. Liver and intestinal injuries were mitigated, and intestinal barrier integrity improved with Akk administration. Analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon sequences showed that Akk induced significant intestinal microbiota alterations, including increased abundance of Akk, Muribaculaceae, Parabacterbides goldsteinii, and decreased abundance of Escherichia_Shigella and Enterobacteriaceae. Collectively, Akk alleviates PICS by enhancing gut barrier function and reshaped the microbial community.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We recently proffered that a new syndrome persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS) has replaced late multiple-organ failure as a predominant phenotype of chronic critical illness. Our goal was to validate this by determining whether severely injured trauma patients with complicated outcomes have evidence of PICS at the genomic level. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of the Inflammation and Host Response to Injury database of adults with severe blunt trauma. Patients were classified into complicated, intermediate, and uncomplicated clinical trajectories. Existing genomic microarray data were compared between cohorts using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. Epidemiologic data and outcomes were also analyzed between cohorts on admission, Day 7, and Day 14. RESULTS: Complicated patients were older, were sicker, and required increased ventilator days compared with the intermediate/ uncomplicated patients. They also had persistent leukocytosis as well as low lymphocyte and albumin levels compared with uncomplicated patients. Total white blood cell leukocyte analysis in complicated patients showed that overall genome-wide expression patterns and those patterns on Days 7 and 14 were more aberrant from control subjects than were patterns from uncomplicated patients. Complicated patients also had significant down-regulation of adaptive immunity and up-regulation of inflammatory genes on Days 7 and 14 (vs. magnitude in fold change compared with control and in magnitude compared with uncomplicated patients). On Day 7, complicated patients had significant changes in functional pathways involved in the suppression of myeloid cell differentiation, increased inflammation, decreased chemotaxis, and defective innate immunity compared with uncomplicated patients and controls. Subset analysis of monocyte, neutrophil, and T-cells supported these findings. CONCLUSION: Genomic analysis of patients with complicated clinical outcomes exhibit persistent genomic expression changes consistent with defects in the adaptive immune response and increased inflammation. Clinical data showed persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and protein depletion. Overall, the data support the hypothesis that patients with complicated clinical outcomes are exhibiting PICS.

abstract = {To investigate an optimal management bundle to improve the survival rate of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). We constructed a treatment bundle based on our clinical investigation, literature, and empirical practice. Intensive management during the acute response stage and infection stage comprised eight main issues: etiology, diagnosis, fluid resuscitation, support of organ function, abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), enteral nutrition, intestinal function, and antibiotics. The intensive management plan included a time-dependent plan for the eight main issues and goal-directed therapy. The plan must be started within the prescribed time (time-dependent endeavors) and must involve the right strategies, right sequence, and right ward for each individual. Effective goal-directed therapy and essential treatment measures must be performed within a specified period of time, and treatment efficacy should be regularly assessed. In 2010, intensive management was initiated in China. Intensive management has significant effects on SAP. This strategy was adopted by 36 hospitals in China, resulting in significant improvements in prognoses. Some criteria of intensive management were adopted by the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP)/American Pancreatic Association Working Group Acute Pancreatitis Guidelines in 2013. Intensive management is an important efficacy-based treatment strategy that can significantly ameliorate prognoses.},

abstract = {Prolonged immunosuppression is increasingly recognized as the major cause of late phase and long-term mortality in sepsis. Numerous murine models with different paradigms, such as lipopolysaccharide injection, bacterial inoculation, and barrier disruption, have been used to explore the pathogenesis of immunosuppression in sepsis or to test the efficacy of potential therapeutic agents. Nonetheless, the reproducibility and translational value of such models are often questioned, owing to a highly heterogeneric, complex, and dynamic nature of immunopathology in human sepsis, which cannot be consistently and stably recapitulated in mice. Despite of the inherent discrepancies that exist between mice and humans, we can increase the feasibility of murine models by minimizing inconsistency and increasing their clinical relevance. In this mini review, we summarize the current knowledge of murine models that are most commonly used to investigate sepsis-induced immunopathology, highlighting their strengths and limitations in mimicking the dysregulated immune response encountered in human sepsis. We also propose potential directions for refining murine sepsis models, such as reducing experimental inconsistencies, increasing the clinical relevance, and enhancing immunological similarities between mice and humans; such modifications may optimize the value of murine models in meeting research and translational demands when applied in studies of sepsis-induced immunosuppression.},

The term “chronic critical illness” (CCI) was proposed for such patients in the mid-80s of the last century. Patients with CCI make up from 5 to 20% of ICRU. Over time, they develop homeostasis disorders resulting in multiple organ failure and death. Mortality in CCI exceeds that of the majority of malignant neoplasms and functional dependence remains in most of survivors. In the present review, the attempt is made to show the main links of CCI pathogenesis which, if acted upon, can prevent unfavorable outcome. The publications describing epidemiology of CCI, its outcomes, and clinical phenotype have been analyzed. Several researchers consider CCI as a result of persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome. Some works show the importance of nutrition for ICRU patients. The role of gastrointestinal tract in CCI formation has been noted. The effect of intensive therapy on microbiota of the ICRU patients has been demonstrated. Microbiome disturbances in dysbiosis and sepsis have been considered, as well as the effect of intestinal microbiome on the distant organs. Post-intensive care syndrome is a significant constituent of CCI. The main sequelae of the syndrome, as well as the general questions of its prevention and treatment, have been denoted.},

Methods A total of 128 malignant tumor patients with pulmonary infection after chemotherapy from January 2014 to January 2018 in Jilin Cancer Hospital were collected. According to whether the patients wrere complicated with PICS, the patients wrere divided into the PICS group (44 cases) and the control group (84 cases). The clinical characteristics and prognosis of the two groups wrere compared, and the risk factors of PICS during hospitalization wrere analyzed. Results The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score in the PICS group wrere higher than those in the control group [(18.6±3.8) vs. (15.9±4.0), t = 3.598, P < 0.01; (4.8±1.5) vs. (4.0± 1.6), t = 2.832, P = 0.005]. When compared with the control group, the proportion of lung cancer in the PICS group wras increased [47.7% (21/44) vs. 23.8% (20/84), $\chi$2 = 8.378, P = 0.006], and the albumin wras decreased [(28.8±3.3) g/L vs. (30.8±2.9) g/L, t = 3.695, P < 0.01], the C reactive protein wras increased [(60±8) mg/L vs. (45±8) mg/L, t = 9.520, P < 0.01], hospital duration was prolonged [(33±7) d vs. (26±7) d, t = 4.820, P < 0.01], hospital mortality was increased [22.7% (10/44) vs. 4.8% (4/84), $\chi$2 - 9.567, P = 0.002]. Multiple factor logistic regression analysis showed that the APACHE II score > 20, lung cancer and the albumin < 30 g/L were the risk factors for PICS in the malignant tumor patients with lung infection after chemotherapy (all P < 0.05). Conclusion The incidence of PICS in malignant tumor patients with pulmonary infection after chemotherapy is high, and the risk factors for the poor prognosis include APACHE II score > 20, lung cancer and the albumin <30 g/L.},

abstract = {Objective: To analyze serial biomarkers of the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS) to gain insight into the pathobiology of chronic critical illness (CCI) after surgical sepsis. Background: Although early deaths after surgical intensive care unit sepsis have decreased and most survivors rapidly recover (RAP), one third develop the adverse clinical trajectory of CCI. However, the underlying pathobiology of its dismal long-term outcomes remains unclear. Methods: PICS biomarkers over 14 days from 124 CCI and 225 RAP sepsis survivors were analyzed to determine associations and prediction models for (1) CCI (≥14 intensive care unit days with organ dysfunction) and (2) dismal 1-year outcomes (Zubrod 4/5 performance scores). Clinical prediction models were created using PIRO variables (predisposition, insult, response, and organ dysfunction). Biomarkers were then added to determine if they strengthened predictions. Results: CCI (vs RAP) and Zubrod 4/5 (vs Zubrod 0-3) cohorts had greater elevations in biomarkers of inflammation (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, interferon gamma-induced protein [IP-10], monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), immunosuppression (IL-10, soluble programmed death ligand-1), stress metabolism (C-reactive protein, glucagon-like peptide 1), and angiogenesis (angiopoietin-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, stromal cell-derived factor) at most time-points. Clinical models predicted CCI on day 4 (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC] = 0.89) and 1 year Zubrod 4/5 on day 7 (AUC = 0.80). IL-10 and IP-10 on day 4 minimally improved prediction of CCI (AUC =0.90). However, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, IP- 10, angiopoietin-2, glucagon-like peptide 1, soluble programmed death ligand-1, and stromal cell-derived factor on day 7 considerably improved the prediction of Zubrod 4/5 status (AUC = 0.88). Conclusions: Persistent elevations of PICS biomarkers in the CCI and Zubrod 4/5 cohorts and their improved prediction of Zubrod 4/5 validate that PICS plays a role in CCI pathobiology.},

abstract = {Dysregulated host immune responses to infection often occur, leading to sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death. Some patients rapidly recover from sepsis, but many develop chronic critical illness (CCI), a debilitating condition that impacts functional outcomes and long-term survival. The “Persistent Inflammation, Immunosuppression, and Catabolism Syndrome” (PICS) has been postulated as the underlying pathophysiology of CCI. We propose that PICS is initiated by an early genomic and cytokine storm in response to microbial invasion during the early phase of sepsis. However, once source control, antimicrobial coverage, and supportive therapies have been initiated, we propose that the persistent inflammation in patients developing CCI is a result of ongoing endogenous alarmin release from damaged organs and loss of muscle mass. This ongoing alarmin and danger-associated molecular pattern signaling causes chronic inflammation and a shift in bone marrow stem cell production toward myeloid cells, contributing to chronic anemia and lymphopenia. We propose that therapeutic interventions must target the chronic organ injury and lean tissue wasting that contribute to the release of endogenous alarmins and the expansion and deposition of myeloid progenitors that are responsible for the propagation and persistence of CCI.},

abstract = {Introduction: Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS) has been proposed as an endotype of chronic critical illness (CCI). The aim of this systematic review is to synthesise the available evidence of risk factors, biomarkers, and biological mechanisms underlying PICS. Methods: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and EMBASE were searched on June 2, 2023. Our population of interest was adult intensive care unit survivors. The exposure group was patients with PICS and the comparator group was patients with no PICS, CCI, or rapid recovery. Mean differences were pooled for each biomarker using a random effects DerSimonian–Laird method. Risk of bias assessment was done using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Results: Six papers were included. Five were single-centre retrospective cohort studies, and one was a prospective cohort study, with sample sizes ranging from 22 to 391 patients. Two studies showed an increased incidence of PICS with age, and two studies showed an association between PICS and Charlson Comorbidity Index scores. PICS was associated with requiring mechanical ventilation in four studies. Meta-analysis showed a 34.4 mg L−1 higher C-reactive protein (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.7–56.2 mg L−1; P<0.01), a 4.4 g L−1 lower albumin (95% CI 0.5–8.3 g L−1; P<0.01), and a 0.36×109 L−1 lower lymphocyte count (95% CI 0.25–0.47×109 L−1; P=0.01) in the PICS compared with the non-PICS group. There are a large variety of other potential biomarkers but limited validation studies. The overall quality of evidence is limited, and these results should be interpreted accordingly. Conclusions: While older patients and those with co-morbidities could be at greater risk for PICS, acquired risk factors, such as injury severity, are potentially more predictive of PICS than intrinsic patient characteristics. There are many potential biomarkers for PICS, but limited validation studies have been conducted. Persistent myeloid-derived suppressor cell expansion, the continual release of danger-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular patterns propagating inflammation, and bioenergetic failure are all mechanisms underlying PICS that could offer potential for novel biomarkers and therapeutic interventions.

@article{Gentile2012,
abstract = {Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) stay of longer than 10 days is often described by the experienced intensivist as a "complicated clinical course" and is frequently attributed to persistent immune dysfunction. "Systemic inflammatory response syndrome" (SIRS) followed by "compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome" (CARS) is a conceptual framework to explain the immunologic trajectory that ICU patients with severe sepsis, trauma, or emergency surgery for abdominal infection often traverse, but the causes, mechanisms, and reasons for persistent immune dysfunction remain unexplained. Often involving multiple-organ failure (MOF) and death, improvements in surgical intensive care have altered its incidence, phenotype, and frequency and have increased the number of patients who survive initial sepsis or surgical events and progress to a persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS). Often observed, but rarely reversible, these patients may survive to transfer to a long-term care facility only to return to the ICU, but rarely to selfsufficiency. We propose that PICS is the dominant pathophysiology and phenotype that has replaced late MOFand prolongs surgical ICU stay, usually with poor outcome. This review details the evolving epidemiology of MOF, the clinical presentation of PICS, and our understanding of how persistent inflammation and immunosuppression define the pathobiology of prolonged intensive care. Therapy for PICS will involve innovative interventions for immune system rebalance and nutritional support to regain physical function and wellbeing.

abstract = {Introduction: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) was first identified in China in December 2019 and is rapidly spreading worldwide as a pandemic. Since COVID-19 causes mild to severe acute respiratory syndrome, most studies in this context have focused on pathogenesis primarily in the respiratory system. However, evidence shows that the central nervous system (CNS) may also be affected by COVID-19. Since COVID-19 is spreading, it is necessary to study its possible cognitive effects on COVID-19 patients and their recovery. Methods: The articles used in this study were searched by keywords, such as cytokine storm and COVID-19, COVID-19 and executive dysfunction, cognitive disorder, and COVID-19, central nervous system (CNS) and COVID-19, coronavirus, neuroinvasion in Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases based on preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) checklist. The study evaluates all observational studies published between December 2019 and April 2021 in peer-reviewed journals, including cross-sectional, cohort, case-control studies, case reports, and case series. The search result was 106 articles, of which 73 articles related to COVID-19, the stages of infection by this virus, its effect on the nervous system and neurological symptoms, the cytokine storm caused by this infection, and the possible cognitive consequences caused by this virus in patients, has been reviewed. Other articles were not checked due to their limited relevance to the topic under discussion. Results: Studies showed that neurons may be directly affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, various studies indicated that systemic inflammation (so-called “cytokine storm”) is also responsible for brain damage induced by infection with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. In such a way that these patients showed elevated levels of interleukin (IL-), 6, 8, and 10 and of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) in their blood. Conclusion: Various cognitive defects have been observed following an increased level of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) and interleukin (IL)-6, 8. Therefore, due to the increased level of these pro-inflammatory factors in the brains of these patients, cognitive deficits can be expected, which need further investigation.},

Materials and methods SAP patients admitted to ICU were eligible for the retrospective cohort study if they needed prolonged intensive care (> 14 days). Post-ICU QOL was assessed by a questionnaire, including 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and record of re-work in a long-term follow-up. Results 214 SAP patients were enrolled, in which 149 (69.6%) patients met the criteria of PICS. PICS patients had more complications and ICU days compared to non-PICS patients (P < 0.001), and their post-ICU mortality was higher (P = 0.046). When adjusted for confounders, PICS was independently associated with higher post-ICU mortality (hazard ratio 4.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 16.3; P = 0.024). The 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) score was lower for PICS group in six subscales (P < 0.001). Only 28.8% patients in the PICS group returned to work compared to 60% patients in the non-PICS group (P = 0.001) Conclusions SAP patients with prolonged ICU stay had a high morbidity of PICS, which was a risk factor for the post-ICU mortality and poor long-term QOL.},

Our study encompassed clinical data from ICU patients admitted between December 2020 and January 2022. The cohort was divided based on the incidence of PICS, and a comparative analysis was conducted on their clinical data. Using logistic regression, we identified independent factors influencing PICS. Among 132 patients meeting our inclusion criteria, 39 (31.70%) developed PICS. Significant differences were observed between the PICS and non-PICS groups in terms of average age, APACHE II scores, hospital stay duration, mortality, and infection rates. Notably, laboratory parameters indicated lower pre-albumin and IL-4 levels, alongside higher IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, and IFN-y levels in the PICS group. Multivariate analysis pinpointed pre-albumin, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 as independent risk factors for PICS in ICU settings.

abstract = {Purpose of reviewLipids have been utilized historically as a calorie dense means to ensure delivery of essential fatty acids (FA). Since the development of mixed lipid emulsion and investigation of immunomodulatory formulas, there has been an awakening that not all lipids are created equal. This narrative review focuses on contemporary evidence in the utilization of lipids (namely omega 3 fatty acids) in both acute and chronic critical illness.Recent findingsThough randomized control trials and meta-Analyses provide little guidance regarding clinical practice for patients suffering from chronic critical illness, available literature suggests the potential to use lipid formulas to decrease the inflammatory cycle that drives catabolism. Additionally, this review will address the expanding evidence that specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) may be the future of immunomodulating inflammation in acute and chronic critical illness and the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolic syndrome (PICS).SummaryAlthough societal guidelines, expert consensus, and literature support the use of omega 3 fatty acids in the acute critically ill population, more research is needed regarding omega 3 fatty acids for chronic critical illness and PICS.},

abstract = {Persistent Inflammation, Immune Suppression, and Catabolism Syndrome (PICS) is a disease state affecting patients who have a prolonged recovery after the acute phase of a large inflammatory insult. Trauma and sepsis are two pathologies after which such an insult evolves. In this review, we will focus on the key clinical determinants of PICS: Immunosuppression and cellular dysfunction. Currently, relevant immunosuppressive functions have been attributed to both innate and adaptive immune cells. However, there are significant gaps in our knowledge, as for trauma and sepsis the immunosuppressive functions of these cells have mostly been described in acute phase of inflammation so far, and their clinical relevance for the development of prolonged immunosuppression is mostly unknown. It is suggested that the initial immune imbalance determines the development of PCIS. Additionally, it remains unclear what distinguishes the onset of immune dysfunction in trauma and sepsis and how this drives immunosuppression in these cells. In this review, we will discuss how regulatory T cells (Tregs), innate lymphoid cells, natural killer T cells (NKT cells), TCR-a CD4- CD8- double-negative T cells (DN T cells), and B cells can contribute to the development of post-traumatic and septic immunosuppression. Altogether, we seek to fill a gap in the understanding of the contribution of lymphocyte immunosuppression and dysfunction to the development of chronic immune disbalance. Further, we will provide an overview of promising diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, whose potential to overcome the detrimental immunosuppression after trauma and sepsis is currently being tested.},

abstract = {Patients who survive the acute phase of sepsis can progress to persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS). Although sepsis is characterized by early hypercoagulability and delayed hypocoagulability, coagulopathy during chronic critical illness is not fully understood. The objective of this study was to determine whether sepsis-induced PICS is associated with coagulation abnormalities. Using our previously described murine PICS model, outbred mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture, and coagulability was characterized after 8 days. We found that during PICS the spleen became markedly enlarged with increased splenocytes and splenic megakaryocytes without a concomitant increase in circulating platelets. Microscopy revealed a nearly sevenfold increase in pulmonary microvascular thrombi in PICS mice, along with significantly decreased pulmonary tidal volumes and inspiratory times and with significantly increased respiratory rates. Thromboelastometry showed that PICS mice had significantly delayed clot initiation time but increased clot firmness. Finally, PICS mice displayed delayed thrombin production and decreased overall thrombin concentrations. All together, these data demonstrate a general dysregulation of coagulation resulting in microthrombus formation and compromised lung function. On the basis of these findings, we propose that consumptive coagulopathy constitutes another cardinal feature of PICS and may contribute to the ongoing tissue damage and multiple organ failure that can occur in chronic critical illness.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Our preliminary studies in a murine model of persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS) suggested that the spleen and lungs may become alternative reservoirs of active neutrophils. We hypothesized that spleen, bone marrow (BM), and lung neutrophils develop altered and distinct phenotypes that contribute to immunosuppression during PICS. METHODS: Mice underwent 33% cecal ligation with a single 25-gauge needle puncture. Spleen, BM, and lung homogenates were harvested 8 days after cecal ligation, when mice display all characteristics of PICS. Neutrophils were identified and enumerated with flow cytometry. Neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected with a dihydrorhodamine (DHR) assay, and phagocytosis was measured with pHrodo succinimidyl ester staining. Student's t-test and ANOVA were used for analysis; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: During PICS, BM neutrophil counts remained stable, while splenic and alveolar neutrophil counts increased by 4-and 2.5-fold, respectively (p<0.05). Neutrophil ROS production increases by 1.5-to 2-fold in spleen, BM, and lungs, with the greatest oxidative burst noted in the spleen (p<0.05). Finally, neutrophil phagocytosis diminished by 30% in BM and increased by 50% in lung (p<0.05); this function remained unchanged in spleen. CONCLUSIONS: During PICS, there is a heterogeneous pool of dysfunctional neutrophils derived from BM, spleen, and lungs. We speculate that these alterations in neutrophil phenotype may contribute to the persistent inflammation and immunosuppression observed during PICS, and may provide potential therapeutic targets for patients who progress to this state.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Sepsis-induced gut microbiome alterations contribute to sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. Given evidence for improved postsepsis outcomes in females compared with males, we hypothesized that female mice maintain microbiota resilience versus males. METHODS Mixed-sex C57BL/6 mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with antibiotics, saline resuscitation, and daily chronic stress and were compared with naive (nonsepsis/no antibiotics) controls. For this work, the results of young (3-5 months) and old (18-22 months) adult mice were analyzed by sex, independent and dependent of age. Mice were sacrificed at days 7 and 14, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on fecal bacterial DNA. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity were determined by Shannon index and Bray-Curtis with principal coordinate analysis, respectively. False discovery rate (FDR) correction was implemented to account for potential housing effect. RESULTS In control mice, there was no difference in $\alpha$ or $\beta$ diversity between male and female mice (FDR, 0.76 and 0.99, respectively). However, male mice that underwent CLP with daily chronic stress had a decrease in microbiota $\alpha$ diversity at 7 days post-CLP (Shannon FDR, 0.005), which was sustained at 14 days post-CLP (Shannon FDR, 0.001), compared with baseline. In addition, male mice maintained differences in $\beta$ diversity even at day 14 compared with controls (FDR, <0.0001). In contrast, female mice had a decreased microbiota $\alpha$ diversity (Shannon FDR, 0.03) and $\beta$ diversity (FDR, 0.02) 7 days post-CLP but recovered their $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity by post-CLP day 14 (Shannon FDR, 0.5, and FDR, 0.02, respectively). Further analysis of females revealed that only young female mice were not different ($\beta$ diversity) post-CLP day 14 to controls. CONCLUSION Although sepsis-induced perturbations of the intestinal microbiota occur initially in both male and female C57BL/6 mice, females demonstrate different microbiota by day 14. This may be seen primarily in younger females. This difference in recovery may play a role in outcome differences between sexes after sepsis.},

abstract = {The nutritional hallmark of chronic critical illness (CCI) after sepsis is persistent inflam-mation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS), which results in global resistance to the anabolic effect of nutritional supplements. This ultimately leaves these patients in a down-ward phenotypic spiral characterized by cachexia with profound weakness, decreased capacity for rehabilitation, and immunosuppression with the propensity for sepsis recidivism. The persistent catabolism is driven by a pathologic low-grade inflammation with the inability to return to homeostasis and by ongoing increased energy expenditure. Better critical care support systems and advances in technology have led to increased intensive care unit (ICU) survival, but CCI due to PICS with poor long-term outcomes has emerged as a frequent phenotype among ICU sepsis survivors. Unfortunately, therapies to mitigate or reverse PICS-CCI are limited, and recent evidence supports that these patients fail to respond to early ICU evidence-based nutrition protocols. A lack of randomized controlled trials has limited strong recommendations for nutrition adjuncts in these patients. However, based on experience in other conditions characterized by a similar phenotype, immunonutrients aimed at counteracting inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism may be important for improving outcomes in PICS-CCI patients. This manuscript intends to review several immunonutrients as adjunctive therapies in treating PICS-CCI.},

abstract = {Background: Multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) has plagued intensive care units (ICUs) for more than four decades, and its epidemiology has evolved because more patients are surviving previously lethal insults. Over the years, different predominant phenotypes of MOD have been described, all of which have consumed tremendous healthcare resources and have been associated with prolonged ICU stays and prohibitive mortality rates. Methods: Review of the English-language literature. Results: By the 1990s, it became widely accepted that MOD could ensue after both infectious and non-infectious insults by what appeared to be a similar auto-destructive systemic inflammatory response. A 1996 analysis recognized that MOD was a bimodal phenomenon. As a result of years of implementation efforts, fewer patients died of early fulminant sepsis, and those who developed MOD survived hospitalization. Unfortunately, a substantial portion of these patients enter a state of persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism (PICS) marked by persistent loss of lean body mass with failure to rehabilitate, sepsis recidivism necessitating re-hospitalization, increasing functional dependence, and an indolent path to death. Conclusion: Unfortunately, as our population ages and peri-operative care improves, PICS will become an insurmountable epidemic. We believe PICS is the next horizon in surgical critical care and have developed a program to study the pathogenesis and novel therapies for this vexing problem.},

Participants: Inclusion: 1) patients ≥18, 2) admitted to the ICU after major surgery or transferred to the ICU within 48 hours after the diagnosis of sepsis following the definition of sepsis-3.0. Exclusion: 1) pregnant or lactating patients, 2) patients with severe immune deficiency, 3) patients that expired within 14 days after the diagnosis of sepsis. Results: A total of 169 participants were included. After propensity score matching, PICS patients were found to have higher intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (32.4% vs 12.4%, p=0.046), 90-day mortality (32.4% vs 9.1%, p=0.006), and ICU-acquired infection rate (44.1% vs 12.7%, p<0.001), and longer ICU stays (29 vs 11 days, p<0.001) comparing to non-PICS patients. In multivariate logistic regression, it demonstrated that the SOFA score, Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI), albumin level on the ICU day 1, and lymphocyte count on the ICU day 3 were statistically significant. Sensitivity analysis was conducted with the receiver operating characteristic curve for a combination of the four parameters and the area under the curve was 0.838 (95% confidence interval 0.774–0.901). Conclusion: The chronic disease condition and decreased immunity in the early course of sepsis were crucial for PICS. The combination of CCI, SOFA score, albumin level on ICU Day 1 and lymphocyte count on ICU Day 3 can be early predictor for PICS.},

abstract = {—Background: Chronic critical illness (CCI), which was characterized by persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS), often leads to muscle atrophy. Serum amyloid A (SAA), a protein upregulated in critical illness myopathy, may play a crucial role in these processes. However, the effects of SAA on muscle atrophy in PICS require further investigation. This study aims to develop a mouse model of PICS combined with bone trauma to investigate the mechanisms underlying muscle weakness, with a focus on SAA. Methods: Mice were used to examine the effects of PICS after bone trauma on immune response, muscle atrophy, and bone healing. The mice were divided into two groups: a bone trauma group and a bone trauma with cecal ligation and puncture group. Tibia fracture surgery was performed on all mice, and PICS was induced through cecal ligation and puncture surgery in the PICS group. Various assessments were conducted, including weight change analysis, cytokine analysis, hematological analysis, grip strength analysis, histochemical staining, and immunofluorescence staining for SAA. In vitro experiments using C2C12 cells (myoblasts) were also conducted to investigate the role of SAA in muscle atrophy. The effects of inhibiting receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) or JAK2 on SAA-induced muscle atrophy were examined. Bioinformatic analysis was conducted using a dataset from the GEO database to identify differentially expressed genes and construct a coexpression network. Results: Bioinformatic analysis confirmed that SAA was significantly upregulated in muscle tissue of patients with intensive care unit–induced muscle atrophy. The PICS animal models exhibited significant weight loss, spleen enlargement, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and altered hematological profiles. Evaluation of muscle atrophy in the animal models demonstrated decreased muscle mass, grip strength loss, decreased diameter of muscle fibers, and significantly increased expression of SAA. In vitro experiment demonstrated that SAA decreased myotube formation, reduced myotube diameter, and increased the expression of muscle atrophy–related genes. Furthermore, SAA expression was associated with activation of the FOXO signaling pathway, and inhibition of RAGE or JAK2/STAT3-FOXO signaling partially reversed SAA-induced muscle atrophy. Conclusions: This study successfully develops a mouse model that mimics PICS in CCI patients with bone trauma.

abstract = {Background: While clinical criteria have been proposed for persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS) using C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, and lymphocyte count, there is no substantial basis for their optimal cut-off values. We herein aimed to develop and externally validate clinical criteria for PICS by investigating the optimal cut-off values for these biomarkers using machine-learning approaches and confirmed it with external validation. Methods: To develop criteria, we included ICU patients treated at a tertiary care hospital in Japan between 2018 and 2021 (derivation cohort). We introduced CRP, albumin and lymphocyte counts at around day 14 into six machine-learning models to predict PICS, defined as the compound outcome of the Barthel index (BI) < 70 at hospital discharge and in-hospital death. We incorporated the results of these models to assess the optimal cut-off values for biomarkers. We then developed and externally validated criteria for PICS using a nationwide claims database in Japan (validation cohort). Results: In the derivation cohort, 291 out of 441 patients had BI < 70 or in-hospital death. Based on machine-learning models, the optimal cut-off values for biomarkers to predict them were a CRP of 2.0 mg/dL, albumin of 3.0 g/dL, and a lymphocyte count of 800/$\mu$L, with an AUROC of 0.67. In the external validation cohort, 4492 out of 15,302 patients had BI < 70 or in-hospital death. The AUROC of the criteria was 0.71, with sensitivity of 0.71 and specificity of 0.68 to predict PICS. Conclusions: We herein provide a fundamental basis for PICS clinical criteria with CRP >2.0 mg/dL, albumin <3.0 g/dL, and a lymphocyte count <800/$\mu$L on day 14. The criteria developed will identify patients with PICS whose long-term mortality and activity of daily living may be poor.},

abstract = {Purpose: Sepsis patients with persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS) have a poor prognosis, and early detection of biomarkers to predict its prognosis is particularly important. The purpose of this study is to investigate the predictive value of glycemic variability (GV) and high density lipid-cholesterol (HDL-C) for secondary PICS in patients with sepsis. Patients and Methods: One hundred and sixty-five patients with sepsis were enrolled in the retrospective study and divided into sepsis secondary PICS and non-PICS group. The daily blood glucose levels from 1 to 7 days after the diagnosis of sepsis were recorded, and GV was calculated. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors of sepsis with PICS, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of GV, and HDL-C for the prognosis of sepsis with PICS. Results: In a study of 165 patients, PICS group tended to have higher GV and lower HDL-C levels than those in the non-PICS group. Logistic regression analysis identified GV and HDL-C as independent risk factors for the secondary PICS of sepsis. The results of ROC curve showed that GV and HDL-C had a certain predictive value for the secondary PICS of sepsis, the sensitivity of GV was 77.5%, specificity of 81.8%, the sensitivity of HDL-C was 76.6%, and specificity of 74.8%. Conclusion: GV and HDL are risk factors for PICS secondary to sepsis and have predictive value for patients' prognosis.},

abstract = {Sepsis has a complex pathophysiology in which both excessive and refractory inflammatory responses are hallmark features. Pro-inflammatory cytokine responses during the early stages are responsible for significant endothelial dysfunction, loss of endothelial integrity, and organ failure. In addition, it is now well-established that a substantial number of sepsis survivors experience ongoing immunological derangement and immunosuppression following a septic episode. The underpinning mechanisms of these phenomena are incompletely understood yet they contribute to a significant proportion of sepsis-associated mortality. Epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, have an increasingly clear role in modulating inflammatory and other immunological processes. Recent evidence suggests epigenetic mechanisms are extensively perturbed as sepsis progresses, and particularly play a role in endothelial dysfunction and immunosuppression. Whilst therapeutic modulation of the epigenome is still in its infancy, there is substantial evidence from animal models that this approach could reap benefits. In this review, we summarize research elucidating the role of these mechanisms in several aspects of sepsis pathophysiology including tissue injury and immunosuppression. We also evaluate pre-clinical evidence for the use of “epi-therapies” in the treatment of poly-microbial sepsis.},

abstract = {Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is a severe disease with a high prevalence and a 3‑15% mortality worldwide, and premature activation of zymogen for any reason is the initial factor for the onset of SAP. Gallstone disease and heavy alcohol consumption are the two most common etiologies of SAP. Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) is a life‑threatening illness, and there are no effective treatments. The relapse state of PICS mainly leads to high mortality due to septic shock or severe trauma, both of which are dangerous and challenging condi‑ tions for clinicians. Thus, it is important for medical staff to identify patients at high risk of PICS and to master the preven‑ tion and treatment of PICS in patients with SAP. The present review aims to increase the understanding of the pathogenesis of PICS, produce evidence for PICS diagnosis and highlight clinical treatment for PICS in patients with SAP. With this information, clinical workers could implement standardized and integrated measures at an early stage of SAP to stop its progression to PICS.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with persistent inflammation–immunosuppression–catabolism syndrome (PICS). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients with SLE who were admitted to the renal intensive care unit (ICU) for over 14 days at Jinling Hospital from July 2010 to July 2018. According to the diagnostic criteria of PICS, we divided the SLE patients into a PICS group and a non-PICS group. We performed a multivariate Cox regression analysis on the risk factors for death in these two groups by comparing the clinical features and prognosis. Results: A total of 96 SLE patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study, including 61 patients in the PICS group and 35 patients in the non-PICS group. The PICS group patients required a longer length of stay in ICU with higher inflammatory indicators (such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and interleukin-6) and lower immune levels (such as total, CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + and CD20 + lymphocytes) compared to the non-PICS group patients (P < 0.01). Hemoglobin, platelets, serum creatinine, serum blood urea nitrogen and SLE Disease Activity Index (SLE-DAI) score in the PICS group were lower than those in the non-PICS group (P < 0.05), suggesting severe hematological injury in the PICS group and relatively severe renal damage in the non-PICS group. The rates of PICS combined with sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, fungi and double infections were higher than those in the non-PICS group (P < 0.05). The 3-year survival rate was 50.82% in the PICS group and 85.71% in the non-PICS group. The 3-year renal survival rate was 32.79% in the PICS group and 51.43% in the non-PICS group. Multivariate Cox regression found that the total lymphocyte count during ICU admission was an independent risk factor for death in SLE patients with PICS. Conclusion: Patients with SLE complicated with PICS had longer ICU stays, a lower level of SLE activity, a higher risk of secondary infection and a significantly lower survival rate than non-PICS patients.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Advances in sepsis management have led to improved short-term survival, but more patients are experiencing a prolonged disease course. We hypothesized that critically ill, septic patients in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) would have poorer long-term outcomes as compared with patients in the medical intensive care unit (MICU), based on iatrogenic tissue damage, inflammation and release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from surgery. METHODS: A prospective, observational study of critically ill, septic, and mechanically ventilated patients at an academic medical center was performed. 1-year outcomes, development of chronic critical illness (CCI, >14 days in intensive care unit) and persistent inflammation, immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) were compared between groups. RESULTS: 74 MICU patients (age 62±16 years, 59% male) and 12 SICU patients (age 62±18 years, 67% male) were included. 25 (34%) of the MICU patients developed CCI, 21 (28%) experienced early death (< 14d of sepsis onset), and 28 (38%) rapidly recovered. By comparison, 5 (42%) of the SICU patients developed CCI, 3 (25%) experienced early death, and 4 (33%) rapidly recovered. APACHE II (p=0.01) and SOFA (p=0.04) scores of MICU patients were higher as compared with SICU patients, although Charlson Comorbidity Index did not differ. There was no difference in the proportion of patients who developed CCI or PICS between groups (p=0.64 for CCI, p=0.19 for PICS). MICU patients had significantly fewer ventilator-free days within the first month (11±11 vs. 22±5 days, p = 0.03), although 28-day mortality was not significantly different. At 1 year follow-up, there was no difference in death-free days (28±57 vs 35±38 days, p=0.79) or Zubrod scores (3.43±1.96 vs 3.09±1.98, p=0.6) between MICU and SICU cohorts, respectively. 28 (90%) MICU survivors were living at home and 3 (10%) survivors were living at a long-term nursing or rehabilitation facility at 1 year. 5 (83%) of SICU survivors were living at home and 1 (17%) was living at a long-term facility. CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill, ventilated patients who have surgical sepsis do not experience improved outcomes as compared with medical patients who have a higher illness severity and who experience longer mechanical ventilation.},

abstract = {Introduction: The definition of chronic critical illness (CCI), or persistent critical illness is not yet well clarified1. The mortality of the CCI is higher than the acute disease, and due to the prolong ICU treatment and the typical complications represents a big medical challenge and financial burden2. Widely accepted the theory of persistent inflammation, immunosuppression catabolism syndrome3,4 in critically ill patient which with high probability play role of the development of CCI. Some promising makers have been found supporting the PICS hypothesis 5, like CRP clustering 1, carbamide/creatinine ratio6, and haematologic alteration7. Objectives: Our goal was to find predictive markers of CCI outcome in severe Covid-19 patients in a tertiary intensive care unit in a university centre. The definition of the CCI was more than 7 days invasive mechanical ventilation and more than 11 days ICU treatment. Methods: During our retrospective study medical data was collected from adult patient admitted in the ICU between 1 November 2020 and 31 October 2021. We include patients who fits into the CCI definition, and exclude who admitted from another ICU, or ECMO centre. Medical history and clinical parameters were collected on the day of admission, and on the day of 7th, and 14th days of treatment. We compared survivors and non-survivors with Mann-Whitney U-test and performed uni- and multivariate logistic regression models to predict ICU mortality. The latter were adjusted to age, gender, and hypertension. Results: We included 89 participants, 55 of them died in the ICU (61.8%). The median age was 60.5 (IQR: 44.5-64) years in the survivor, and 63 (IQR: 57-72) years in the non-survivor group. There was no significant difference between survivors and non-survivors in conventional prognostic markers (age, BMI, APACHE II score). History of hypertension (67.3% vs. 44.1%, respectively; p = 0.033) were more frequent among deceased patients. With multivariate logistic regression serum albumin levels (OR: 0.72, 95%CI: 0.585-0.887, p = 0.02), and CRP (OR: 1,012, 95%CI: 1.005-1.018, p < 0.001) on day 7 were independently associated with ICU mortality. Nonetheless, ascending CRP levels from day 0 to 14 (OR: 1.007; 95% CI: 1.003-1.012; p = 0.001) and elevation in carbamide levels from day 7 to 14 showed also higher risk for ICU death (OR: 1.144, 95%CI: 1.046-1.251, p = 0.03). Conclusion: CCI cause high mortality and huge medical challenge in the ICU. According to our results, persistently elevated CRP, high carbamide and low albumin levels in the chronic phase showed correlation with ICU mortality.},

abstract = {Developing hypernatremia while on intensive care unit (ICU) is a common problem with various undesirable effects. A link to persistent inflammation, immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) can be established in two ways. On the one hand, hypernatremia can lead to inflammation and catabolism via hyperosmolar cell stress, and on the other, profound catabolism can lead to hypernatremia via urea-induced osmotic diuresis. In this retrospective single-center study, we examined 115 patients with prolonged ICU stays (≥14 days) and sufficient renal function. Depending on their serum sodium concentrations between ICU day 7 and 21, allocation to a hypernatremic (high) and a nonhypernatremic group (low) took place. Distinct signs of PICS were detectable within the complete cohort. Thirty-three of them (28.7%) suffered from ICU-acquired hypernatremia, which was associated with explicitly higher signs of inflammation and ongoing catabolism as well as a prolonged ICU length of stay. Catabolism was discriminated better by the urea generation rate and the urea-to-creatinine ratio than by serum albumin concentration. An assignable cause for hypernatremia was the urea-induced osmotic diuresis. When dealing with ICU patients requiring prolonged treatment, hypernatremia should at least trigger thoughts on PICS as a contributing factor. In this regard, the urea-to-creatinine ratio is an easily accessible biomarker for catabolism.},

This manuscript aims to depict the evolution of single organ failure through multiple organ failure, ending in the newest phenotype called persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, catabolism syndrome (PICS). Among the other MOF phenotypes discussed are systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome. Along with a review of the four phenotypes of MOF there is a review of the current literature on nutritional supplementation. Discussed in these sections are possible etiologies for the various progression of MOF, total enteral nutrition (TPN) versus early enteral nutrition (EEN), early versus late parenteral nutrition, glycemic control, and new enteral formulas. Finally, as the newest phenotype, PICS, has evolved we try to make inferences from similar pathologic states to recommend nutritional support that has proven beneficial.},

abstract = {Background: Persistent Inflammation, Immunosuppression, and Catabolism Syndrome (PIICS) is a significant contributor to adverse long-term outcomes in severe trauma patients. Objective: The objective of this study was to establish and validate a PIICS predictive model in severe trauma patients, providing a practical tool for early clinical prediction. Patients and methods: Adult severe trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of ≥16, admitted between October 2020 and December 2022, were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set in a 7:3 ratio. Patients were classified into PIICS and non-PIICS groups based on diagnostic criteria. LASSO regression was used to select appropriate variables for constructing the prognostic model. A logistic regression model was developed and presented in the form of a nomogram. The performance of the model was evaluated using calibration and ROC curves. Results: A total of 215 patients were included, consisting of 155 males (72.1%) and 60 females (27.9%), with a median age of 51 years (range: 38–59). NRS2002, ISS, APACHE II, and SOFA scores were selected using LASSO regression to construct the prognostic model. The AUC of the ROC analysis for the predictive model in the validation set was 0.84 (95% CI 0.72–0.95). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test in the validation set yielded a $\chi$2 value of 14.74, with a value of p of 0.098. Conclusion: An accurate and easily implementable PIICS risk prediction model was established. It can enhance risk stratification during hospitalization for severe trauma patients, providing a novel approach for prognostic prediction.},

abstract = {Background: Immunosuppression is a risk factor for poor prognosis of critically ill patients, but current monitoring of the immune status in clinical practice is still inadequate. Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is not only a convenient biomarker for immune status monitoring but is also suitable for clinical application. In this study, we aimed to explore different trajectories of ALC, and evaluate their relationship with prognosis in critically ill patients. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 10,619 critically ill patients admitted to a general intensive care unit (ICU) with 56 beds from February 2016 to May 2020. Dynamic ALC was defined as continuous ALC from before ICU admission to 5 days after ICU admission. Initial ALC was defined as the minimum ALC within 48 h after ICU admission. Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was used to group critically ill patients according to dynamic ALC. Multivariate cox regression model was used to determine the independent association of trajectory endotypes with death and persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, catabolism syndrome (PICS). Results: A total of 2022 critically ill patients were unsupervisedly divided into four endotypes based on dynamic ALC, including persistent lymphopenia endotype (n = 1,211; 58.5%), slowly rising endotype (n = 443; 22.6%), rapidly decreasing endotype (n = 281; 14.5%) and normal fluctuation endotype (n = 87; 4.4%). Among the four trajectory endotypes, the persistent lymphopenia endotype had the highest incidence of PICS (24.9%), hospital mortality (14.5%) and 28-day mortality (10.8%). In multivariate cox regression model, persistent lymphopenia was associated with increased risk of 28-day mortality (HR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.06–2.23), hospital mortality (HR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.20–2.29) and PICS (HR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.09–2.94), respectively. Sensitivity analysis further confirmed that the ALC trajectory model of non-infected patients and non-elderly patients can accurately distinguished 91 and 90% of critically ill patients into the same endotypes as the original model, respectively. Conclusion: The ALC trajectory model is helpful for grouping critically ill patients, and early persistent lymphopenia is associated with poor prognosis. Notably, persistent lymphopenia may be a robust signal of immunosuppression in critically ill patients.},

@article{Nakamura2020,
abstract = {Purpose: Among patients surviving treatment in intensive care units (ICU), some cases exist for which inflammation persisted with prolonged hospital stays, referred as persistent inflammatory, immunosuppressed, catabolic syndrome (PIICS). C reactive protein (CRP) is regarded as the most important marker for PIICS. Nevertheless, the applicable cut-off of CRP for PIICS has never been described in the literature. Methods: Data of patients admitted to the ICU/Emergency ward from May 2015 through June 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Using K-means clustering, a 14-day CRP transition dataset was analyzed and categorized finally into 7 classes: 4 PIICS classes and 3 non-PIICS classes. Outcomes and the other PIICS characteristics were evaluated. Results: From all 5513 admitted patients, this study examined data of 539 patients who had been admitted for more than 14 days, and for whom 14 day CRP transition analysis could be performed. By the CRP transitions of 7 categorized classes, the CRP cut-off for PIICS was regarded as 3.0 mg/dl on day 14. The Barthel Index at discharge, albumin, and total lymphocyte counts on day 14 were significantly lower in PIICS classes than those of non-PIICS classes. Creatinine kinase, antithrombin activity and thrombomodulin on admission were regarded as independent risk factors for PIICS. Conclusions: Among patients with prolonged hospital stay, the PIICS population had elevated CRP, but lower Barthel Index, albumin, and total lymphocyte counts. The criterion of day 14 CRP for PIICS should be 3.0 mg/dl.},

abstract = {Background: The mechanisms underlying the increased mortality of secondary infections during the immunosuppressive phase of sepsis remain elusive. Objectives: We sought to investigate the role of Siglec-F+ neutrophils on splenic T lymphocytes in the immunosuppressed phase of sepsis and on secondary infection in PICS mice, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: We established a mouse model of sepsis-induced immunosuppression followed by secondary infection with LPS or E. coli. The main manifestation of immunosuppression is the functional exhaustion of splenic T lymphocytes. Treg depletion reagent Anti-IL-2, IL-10 blocker Anti-IL-10R, macrophage depletion reagent Liposomes, neutrophil depletion reagent Anti-Ly6G, neutrophil migration inhibitor SB225002, Siglec-F depletion reagent Anti-Siglec-F are all used on PICS mice. The function of neutrophil subsets was investigated by adoptive transplantation and the experiments in vitro. Results: Compared to other organs, we observed a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the spleen, accompanied by a marked increase in IL-10 production, primarily by infiltrating neutrophils. These infiltrating neutrophils in the spleen during the immunosuppressive phase of sepsis undergo phenotypic change in the local microenvironment, exhibiting high expression of neutrophil biomarkers such as Siglec-F, Ly6G, and Siglec-E. Depletion of neutrophils or specifically targeting Siglec-F leads to enhance the function of T lymphocytes and a notable improvement in the survival of mice with secondary infections. Conclusions: We identified Siglec-F+ neutrophils as the primary producers of IL-10, which significantly contributed to T lymphocyte suppression represents a novel finding with potential therapeutic implications.},

This study aimed to investigate the effect of RK-33, a specific inhibitor of DDX3X, on the progression of sepsis to persistent inflammation, immune suppression and catabolism syndrome(PICS). Methods: The septic mice model was established using caecal ligation and perforation (CLP). The mice were randomly divided into four groups: sham group, sham + RK-33 group (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection, once a day), CLP group and CLP + RK-33 group (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection, once a day). The number of inflammatory cells in the peripheral blood, spleen and bone marrow was calculated, and inflammatory cytokines were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The septic mice's body weight and skeletal muscle mass were measured, and skeletal muscle tissues were examined using eosin staining. Western blotting was performed to detect the expression levels of MuRF1, atrogin1 and NLRP3 in the skeletal muscle of septic mice. Additionally, reactive oxidative species, superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde were measured using commercial kits. Results: RK-33 reduced inflammatory cell counts and cytokine levels in CLP mice, ameliorated the decline in CD4 and CD8 T cells and prevented the loss of body weight and skeletal muscle mass in septic mice. Additionally, RX-33 reduced oxidative stress in the skeletal muscle of septic mice. Conclusion: In the established sepsis mouse model, RK-33 alleviated inflammation and oxidative stress, ameliorated CLP-induced immunosuppression and skeletal muscle atrophy and improved survival. These findings suggest that RK-33 could be a novel potential therapeutic agent for preventing the progression of sepsis to PICS.},

abstract = {Background Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS) has impacted on long-term prognosis of patients with trauma. We aimed to identify patients with trauma at risk of PICS-related complications early in the intensive care unit (ICU) course. Methods A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted. All consecutive patients with trauma who had stayed in the ICU for >7 days were included in the study. We developed the prediction score for the incidence of PICS-related outcomes in the derivation cohort for the initial period and then evaluated in the validation cohort for the subsequent period. Other outcomes were also assessed using the score. Results In total, 170 and 133 patients were included in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The prediction score comprised the variables indicating PICS presence, including a maximum value of C-reactive protein >15 mg/dL, minimum value of albumin <2.5 g/dL, and an episode of nosocomial infection for the first 7 days after admission. A score of 1 was assigned to each variable. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the score to predict PICS incidence was 0.74 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.81) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.81) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The higher score was also significantly associated with a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at day 14, a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, a longer length of stay in ICU, and experienced multiple episodes of infection. Similar results were obtained in the validation cohort. Conclusions Our scoring system could predict the outcomes associated with PICS among patients with trauma. Because the score comprised the parameters measured for the first 7 days during the ICU course, it could contribute to identifying patients at a high risk of unfavorable outcome earlier.

Methods: This is a prospective observational clinical study. During this study period, we collect intensive care unit patients' data from Suzhou Municipal Hospital and Suzhou Ninth People's Hospital. All patients older than 18 years were included, and according to the corresponding exclusion and diagnostic criteria, they were divided into four groups: PICS group, CCI group, CCI and PICS group (CCI + PICS), and neither CCI nor PICS group (NCCI + NPICS) and collected and recorded age, sex, hospital time, hospital diagnosis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, C-reactive protein, absolute value lymphocyte count, serum albumin, white blood cell count, absolute value neutrophil count, secondary infection, and 28-day case fatality rate separately. Results: A total of 687 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit during the study period. The hospitalization time less than 14 days were excluded, and 168 patients were eventually included. There are 17 in the PICS group, 71 in the CCI group, 50 in the CCI + PICS group, and 30 in the NCCI + NPICS group. Baseline characteristics showed statistically significant differences in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, length of hospital stay, and 28-day mortality among four groups. Baseline main indicator and multiple comparisons showed that the CCI + PICS group had longer hospital stay, worse prognosis, and more adverse outcomes. Multivariate analysis showed that final age, C-reactive protein on days 14 and 21, and serum albumin on days 1 and 21 had an impact on the prognosis (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The clinical prognosis of the four groups decreased in order of NCCI + NPICS, CCI, PICS, and CCI + PICS. Our finding of clinically isolated PICS may indicate that PICS acts as an inducement or independent factor to worsen the prognosis of CCI.},

abstract = {Clinical and technological advances promoting early hemorrhage control and physiologic resuscitation as well as early diagnosis and optimal treatment of sepsis have significantly decreased in-hospital mortality for many critically ill patient populations. However, a substantial proportion of severe trauma and sepsis survivors will develop protracted organ dysfunction termed chronic critical illness (CCI), defined as ≥ 14 days requiring intensive care unit (ICU) resources with ongoing organ dysfunction. A subset of CCI patients will develop the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS), and these individuals are predisposed to a poor quality of life and indolent death. We propose that CCI and PICS after trauma or sepsis are the result of an inappropriate bone marrow response characterized by the generation of dysfunctional myeloid populations at the expense of lympho- and erythropoiesis. This review describes similarities among CCI/PICS phenotypes in sepsis, cancer, and aging and reviews the role of aberrant myelopoiesis in the pathophysiology of CCI and PICS. In addition, we characterize pathogen recognition, the interface between innate and adaptive immune systems, and therapeutic approaches including immune modulators, gut microbiota support, and nutritional and exercise therapy. Finally, we discuss the future of diagnostic and prognostic approaches guided by machine and deep-learning models trained and validated on big data to identify patients for whom these approaches will yield the greatest benefits. A deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of CCI and PICS and continued investigation into novel therapies harbor the potential to improve the current dismal long-term outcomes for critically ill post-injury and post-infection patients.},

abstract = {Persistent Inflammation, Immunosuppression, and Catabolism Syndrome (PICS) is a multifactorial condition characterized by prolonged inflammation, immune dysfunction, and muscle wasting that occurs in some critically ill patients after they have recovered from their acute illness [1] [2]. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation is a common viral infection observed in critically ill patients and has been associated with immune dysregulation [3] [4]. This study aims to investigate the incidence of CMV reactivation in critical patients who have developed PICS. Patients and methods: This is a data-based, observational, and cohort study. All patients with CMV reactivation admitted to the ICU between January 01, 2018, and May 01, 2023, were reviewed and those with PICS were analyzed. CMV reactivation was defined as CMV DNA ≥1000 copies/ml in tracheal samples. PICS was assessed using established clinical criteria, including inflammation and muscle wasting markers, at regular intervals during the ICU stay. The patient population was analyzed in two groups: CMV-reactivated PICS patients and CMV-non-reactivated PICS patients. Results: During the study period, CMV reactivation was detected in 85.5% of all PICS patients. The results showed that the CMV-positive group had significantly higher APACHE-II scores at ICU admission and a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and cancer. According to the multivariate logistic regression model for CMV reactivation, APACHE-II score, steroid use, and the presence of thrombocytopenia were identified as significant variables. Additionally, the CMV-positive group was found to have a higher mortality rate. Conclusion: The incidence of CMV reactivation is very high in patients with PICS, and this condition appears to be associated with worse outcomes. Comorbidities such as steroid use, cancer, and diabetes mellitus are considered risk factors. Our findings suggest that CMV testing should be considered in patients suspected of having PICS. Understanding the relationship between CMV reactivation and PICS could pave the way for potential biomarker-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, enabling early identification and intervention for individuals at risk. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate CMV reactivation's precise mechanisms and clinical implications in these complex syndromes.},

abstract = {Background: Many sepsis survivors develop chronic critical illness (CCI) and are assumed to be immunosuppressed, but there is limited clinical evidence to support this. We sought to determine whether the incidence of secondary infections and immunosuppressive biomarker profiles of patients with CCI differ from those with rapid recovery (RAP) after sepsis. Methods: This prospective observational study evaluated 88 critically ill patients with sepsis and 20 healthy controls. Cohorts were defined based on clinical trajectory (early death, RAP, or CCI), whereas immunosuppression was clinically determined by the presence of a postsepsis secondary infection. Serial blood samples were collected for absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs), monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR) expression, and plasma-soluble programmed death-ligand 1 (sPD-L1) concentrations. Results: Of the 88 patients with sepsis, 3 (3%) died within 14 days of sepsis onset, 50 (57%) experienced RAP, and 35 (40%) developed CCI. Compared with RAP patients, CCI patients exhibited a higher incidence and overall number of infections adjusted for hospital length of stay. ALC and mHLA-DR levels were dramatically reduced at the time of sepsis diagnosis when compared with healthy controls, whereas sPD-L1 concentrations were significantly elevated. There were no differences between RAP and CCI patients in ALC, sPD-L1, or mHLA-DR at the time of diagnosis or within 24 h after sepsis diagnosis. However, in contrast to the RAP group, CCI patients failed to exhibit any trend toward restoration of normal values of ALC, HLA-DR, and sPD-L1. Conclusions: Septic patients demonstrate clinical and biological evidence to suggest they are immunosuppressed at the time of sepsis diagnosis. Those who develop CCI have a greater incidence of secondary infections and persistently aberrant markers of impaired host immunity, although measurements at the time of sepsis onset did not distinguish between subjects with RAP and CCI.},

abstract = {Background: Persistent inflammatory catabolic syndrome (PICS) has not been described in the infant population. This study proposes a definition of PICS in critically ill infants. Methods: A published adult criterion of PICS was modified using anthropometric and biochemical reference ranges for infants. A prospective chart review of admissions to a tertiary surgical neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was performed over 65 days. Demographic, anthropometric, biochemical, and other clinical variables such as length of stay and medication use were collected daily throughout admission. Infants were categorized as having or not having PICS. Results: Twenty percent of admitted infants (n = 15) developed PICS using the proposed criteria. Infants with PICS were more likely to be classified as failure to thrive (53%), meeting only 75% of their anticipated weight gain. Significantly more infants with PICS had undergone surgery (100%; P = .01), received inotropic medication (40%; P = .05), and had longer NICU and total hospital length of stay ( P < .001 and P < .001). Infants with PICS had higher peak glucose levels (11.8 ± 7.3 mmol/L) and elevated urea concentrations (7.9 ± 4.6 mmol/L). Conclusions: PICS does exist in a critically ill neonatal population and may be identified using the definition proposed in this study. Infants with PICS displayed metabolic dysregulation, impaired expected growth velocity, and longer length of stay despite no differences in severity scores or diagnosis between the groups. Validation of this work is required, and research into timely identification of infants with PICS is needed to inform whether these infants would benefit from earlier and novel nutrition intervention.},

abstract = {T cell activation is a highly regulated process involving peptide-MHC engagement of the T cell receptor and positive costimulatory signals. Upon activation, coinhibitory 'checkpoints', including programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), become induced to regulate T cells. PD1 has an essential role in balancing protective immunity and immunopathology, homeostasis and tolerance. However, during responses to chronic pathogens and tumours, PD1 expression can limit protective immunity. Recently developed PD1 pathway inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment for some patients, but the majority of patients do not show complete responses, and adverse events have been noted. This Review discusses the diverse roles of the PD1 pathway in regulating immune responses and how this knowledge can improve cancer immunotherapy as well as restore and/or maintain tolerance during autoimmunity and transplantation.},

Instead of fighting disease, immune cells may increase pathology and suppress host-protective immune responses. Myeloid cells show high plasticity and adapt to changing conditions and pathological challenges. Despite their relevance in disease pathophysiology, the identity, heterogeneity and biology of myeloid cells is still poorly understood. We will focus on phenotypical and functional markers of one of the key myeloid regulatory subtypes, the myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), in humans, mice and non-human primates. Technical issues regarding the isolation of the cells from tissues and blood, timing and sample handling of MDSC will be detailed. Localization of MDSC in a tissue context is of crucial importance and immunohistochemistry approaches for this purpose are discussed. A minimal antibody panel for MDSC research is provided as part of the Mye-EUNITER COST action. Strategies for the identification of additional markers applying state of the art technologies such as mass cytometry will be highlighted. Such marker sets can be used to study MDSC phenotypes across tissues, diseases as well as species and will be crucial to accelerate MDSC research in health and disease.},

Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) plays a vital role in inhibiting immune responses and promoting self-tolerance through modulating the activity of T-cells, activating apoptosis of antigen-specific T cells and inhibiting apoptosis of regulatory T cells. Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a trans-membrane protein that is considered to be a co-inhibitory factor of the immune response, it can combine with PD-1 to reduce the proliferation of PD-1 positive cells, inhibit their cytokine secretion and induce apoptosis. PD-L1 also plays an important role in various malignancies where it can attenuate the host immune response to tumor cells. Based on these perspectives, PD-1/PD-L1 axis is responsible for cancer immune escape and makes a huge effect on cancer therapy.

Spiritual care was seen as attention for spirituality, presence, empowerment, and bringing peace. It implied creative, narrative, and ritual work. Though several studies reported positive effects of spiritual care, like the easing of discomfort, the evidence for spiritual care is low. Requirements for implementation of spiritual care in (palliative) care were: Developing spiritual competency, including self-reflection, and visibility of spirituality and spiritual care, which are required from spiritual counselors that they participated in existing organizational structures.

abstract = {Purpose of review: Within the hospice and palliative care movement, patients' religion/spirituality (R/S) has been a core component of care incorporated within international and US palliative care guidelines. However, as the discipline of palliative care has been incorporated into the larger biomedical community, the inclusion of spiritual care has become controversial. This review summarizes key empirical research at the intersection of palliative care and R/S in order to assess its validity as a domain of end-of-life care. Recent findings: Recent research shows that R/S and spiritual care are important components to the care of patients facing advanced illness. Patients - particularly ethnic minorities - rely upon R/S as an important means to interpret and cope with illness. Studies suggest that R/S plays an important role in coping with disease-related symptoms, improves quality of life, and impacts medical decision-making near death. Patients largely desire medical caregivers to take an active role in providing spiritual care, and patients likewise frequently experience multiple spiritual needs arising in the face of life-threatening illness. Summary: Despite an empirical evidence for spiritual care as part of palliative care, R/S remains insufficiently addressed by the medical system. Further research is required in order to more clearly identify the roles of healthcare providers and standardize the provision of spiritual care within palliative care. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract = {Context: Financial toxicity (FT) is used to describe the financial distress/hardship associated with cancer and its treatment. Objectives: The aim of this review was to explore the relationship between FT and symptom burden. Method: A systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL (from January 2000 to January 2018) and accepted quantitative, mixed-methods and qualitative studies. Data were extracted and appraised by two reviewers. Owing to significant heterogeneity in the included studies, a narrative synthesis was performed. Results: Nine studies involving 11,544 cancer survivors were included. Of these nine studies, eight were of high quality. The relationships between FT and psychological symptoms and physical symptoms were examined in eight and three studies, respectively. Six studies reported a positive relationship between FT and depression. Three studies found a positive association between FT and anxiety. Limited evidence was found for an association between FT and stress, fear of recurrence, spiritual suffering, pain, and overall symptom burden. Conclusions: A relatively clear association exists between FT and psychological symptoms. Clinicians should regularly screen for, assess, and manage emotional distress that may be attributed to FT. Although the causal pathway is not known, future intervention studies aimed at minimizing or preventing FT should evaluate psychological symptoms as secondary outcomes. Little is known about the relationships between FT and physical symptoms. Future research should overcome methodological limitations by incorporating longitudinal data collection, use of mixed-methods approaches, and homogeneity of samples.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the access of patients with lung cancer in a densely populated area of S{\~{a}}o Paulo to the Brazilian Public Health System, focusing on the time spent from symptom onset or initial diagnosis until the beginning of treatment. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 509 patients with malignant lung neoplasms who were admitted to a single reference oncology center of the public health system between July 2008 and December 2014. Patients were considered eligible for this study if they were older than 18 years and had not undergone any previous oncology treatment when they were admitted to the institution. The following data were collected from all patients: age, gender, smoking status, tumor staging, time from the when the first symptoms were experienced by the patient to when the patient was diagnosed with cancer, time from the first appointment to cancer diagnosis, and time from when the patient was diagnosed with cancer to the initiation of treatment. RESULTS: The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was three months. From the first appointment to diagnosis, the median time interval was one month; however, 79% of patients were diagnosed in up to two months. The median time from diagnosis to the start of treatment was one month, but most patients (82.5%) started treatment in up to two months. CONCLUSION: In our highly populated region with preferential access to the public health system, patients are required to wait a relatively long time to effectively begin treatment for lung cancer. This type of study is important to alert medical societies and government health agencies.},

abstract = {Background: Financial toxicity includes distress and burden from cancer-related costs. Women are more likely to experience worse cancer-related financial outcomes than men. This study evaluated breast and gynecologic cancer patients' subjective experiences of financial toxicity and associations with distress and quality of life (QOL). Methods: A cross-sectional survey study included measures of financial toxicity (Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity [COST] Version 2), distress (Patient Health Questionnaire), and QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy). Chi-square, t-tests, and ANOVAs examined bivariate relationships. Two regression models tested associations between financial toxicity and distress and QOL, controlling for covariates. Financial toxicity subgroups were compared based on a validated grading system. Results: Participants (N = 273; 74% breast cancer) averaged 54.65 years (SD = 12.08), were 3.42 years (SD = 4.20) post-diagnosis, and 33% reported cancer-related change in employment status. Financial toxicity was “mild” overall (COST M = 26.11, SD = 11.14); 32% worried about cancer-related financial problems (quite a bit/very much; item-level analysis). Worse financial toxicity related to younger age (p < 0.001), identifying as a non-Asian minority (p = 0.03) or Hispanic (p = 0.01), being single (p < 0.001), lower education (p = 0.004), lower income (p < 0.001), late-stage disease (p = 0.001), recurrent disease (p = 0.004), and active treatment (p < 0.001). In separate multivariable models, greater financial toxicity related to greater distress ($\beta$ = −0.45 p < 0.001) and worse QOL ($\beta$ = 0.58, p < 0.001). Financial toxicity subgroups reported clinically significant differences in distress and QOL (p's < 0.05). Conclusions: Cancer-related financial burden is associated with pervasive negative effects and may impact subgroups differently. Future research should explore financial experiences across subgroups, aiming to better identify those at risk and build targeted interventions.},

abstract = {The role of nutritional support for cancer patients in palliative care is still a controversial topic, in part because there is no consensus on the definition of a palliative care patient because of ambiguity in the common medical use of the adjective palliative. Nonetheless, guidelines recommend assessing nutritional deficiencies in all such patients because, regardless of whether they are still on anticancer treatments or not, malnutrition leads to low performance status, impaired quality of life (QoL), unplanned hospitalizations, and reduced survival. Because nutritional interventions tailored to individual needs may be beneficial, guidelines recommend that if oral food intake remains inadequate despite counseling and oral nutritional supplements, home enteral nutrition or, if this is not sufficient or feasible, home parenteral nutrition (supplemental or total) should be considered in suitable patients. The purpose of this narrative review is to identify in these cancer patients the area of overlapping between the two therapeutic approaches consisting of nutritional support and palliative care in light of the variables that determine its identification (guidelines, evidence, ethics, and law). However, nutritional support for cancer patients in palliative care may be more likely to contribute to improving their QoL when part of a comprehensive early palliative care approach.},

abstract = {Spirituality has been identified as an adaptive coping strategy and a predictor of better quality of life in cancer patients. Despite the relevance of spirituality in the health–disease process, it is noted that the assessment of the impact of spirituality in coping with pain is still incipient. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of spirituality in coping with pain in cancer patients. This quantitative cross-sectional study was carried out in a medium-sized hospital and a cancer patient support institution located in northeastern Brazil. A questionnaire with sociodemographic and clinical variables was used and the following instruments were applied: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS); Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ); Neuropathic Pain 4 Questions (DN4); Spiritual Wellbeing Scale (SWBS); WHOQOL Spirituality, Religiousness and Personal Beliefs (WHOQOL-SRPB). Most people with no pain had higher scores on the SWBS. Neuropathic pain was identified in 23 patients and was associated with the highest level of spirituality used as a way of coping with pain. As faith increases, pain decreases in intensity by 0.394 points. On the other hand, as inner peace increases, pain increases by 1.485 points. It is concluded that faith is a strategy for coping with pain, in particular neuropathic pain, minimizing its intensity. On the other hand, greater levels of inner peace allow to increase the awareness of the painful sensation. It is expected that these findings may be useful to integrate spirituality care in healthcare facilities as a resource for positive coping for people in the process of becoming ill, contributing to the therapeutic path and favouring a new meaning to the experience of the disease.},

The objective of this study was to present an overview of the scientific production referring to evaluation of the pain and total pain of patients with advanced cancer in palliative care. The study involved an integrative literature review, searching the databases PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, Lilacs and Web of Science using the descriptors ‘Total Pain', ‘Cancer Pain', ‘Pain', ‘Symptom Assessment', ‘Pain Measurement', ‘Pain Evaluation', ‘Neoplasms', ‘Cancer', ‘Tumor', ‘Palliative Care', ‘Hospice Care', and ‘Terminal Care'. To select the studies, the authors used the reference manager Mendeley and the application Rayyan™, as well as blind and independent peer review. Twenty-two articles were selected, published between 2002 and 2020 in different countries, and classified into two thematic units: ‘Physical, social, emotional, and spiritual factors related to pain in cancer' (N = 13) and ‘Importance of the overall evaluation and multidisciplinary team in the management of pain' (N = 9). Advanced cancer is associated with high mortality, a decline in health status, the presence of pain, and complex psychosocial concerns. Pain and symptoms in patients in palliative care should be evaluated as a whole and controlled thorough the work of an interdisciplinary team. The qualitative synthesis of the results demonstrates that most of the evaluated studies have a mixed nature; there are significant methodological differences among them and a low level of evidence in studies relating to the subject of pain evaluation in palliative care.},

abstract = {Purpose: To analyze the relationship between the subjective experience of distress and the use of religious and/or spiritual coping by adult chemotherapy patients. Method: A cross-sectional study conducted in 2018, with 100 patients undergoing chemotherapy. The data were collected through three tools: a characterization form, the Inventory of Subjective Distress Experiences in Illness, and the Brief Religious/Spiritual Coping Scale. The analysis was based on descriptive and inferential statistics, using the Spearman correlation test (p < 0.05), ANOVA, the Kruskall-Wallis test, and negative binomial regression. Results: A low level of overall, physical, existential, psychological and sociorelational distress was observed. The dimension of positive distress experiences, however, was above the intermediate level in the scale. With respect to coping, use of positive and negative facets was moderate and low, respectively. Very weak positive correlations were noted between negative coping and physical, existential, and overall distress. The regression analysis indicated a higher risk of distress with increasing age and greater negative religious coping. Conclusions: In this sample, higher means were found in the dimension of positive distress experiences; negative coping, although utilized less, had greater potential to exacerbate distress after adjustment for age, in contrast to that expected for positive coping, which did not manifest significant effects in alleviating it.},

Across-sectional survey with aconvenient sample of ambulatory palliative care patients investigated their psychological pain through the Hospital Anxiety and Depressive (HAD) scale and their use of spirituality using the Brief Religious/spiritual coping (BriefRCOPE) scale. Alinear regression model, using the HADS-depression as outcome variable and the BriefRCOPE as the independent variable, adjusting for confounding variables, investigated the possible association between these variables. Due to methodological limitations, just 40 out 130 potential participants were assessed, with 40percent showing depressive symptoms.

abstract = {Background: Nutritional impairment is common in cancer patients and adversely affects quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between nutritional status and QoL in incurable cancer patients in palliative care. Methods: A prospective cohort with incurable cancer patients referred to the specialized Palliative Care Unit of the National Cancer Institute in Brazil was conducted. The nutritional risk (NR) was assessed using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment short form (PG-SGA SF), and cancer cachexia (CC) was defined according to the international consensus. QoL was evaluated using the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 Palliative (QLQ-C15-PAL). Multivariate linear regressions analyses were performed to assess the relationship between the nutritional status and QoL scores. Results: A total of 1039 consecutive patients were included. A high prevalence of NR (85.4%) and CC (78.7%) were observed. The patients with worse nutritional status presented significantly poorer physical, emotional, symptoms domains scales, and overall QoL. CC were significantly associated with QoL scores for dyspnea (p = 0.013), insomnia (p = 0.046), and appetite loss (p = 0.015), while NR were associated with all the QoL domains scales covered in QLQ-C15-PAL. Conclusion: Our findings support that impaired nutritional status was associated with poor QoL in incurable cancer patients. NR assessed by PG-SGA SF better reflects physical, emotional, symptom burden, and overall QoL scores. Thus, this tool may contribute in identifying patients at risk of deterioration QoL.},

abstract = {OBJETIVO: Muitas vezes pacientes com c{\^{a}}ncer de pulm{\~{a}}o vivenciam mudan{\c{c}}as f{\'{i}}sicas e psicossociais profundas que resultam da progress{\~{a}}o da doen{\c{c}}a ou dos efeitos colaterais do tratamento. Fadiga, dor, dispneia, depress{\~{a}}o e dist{\'{u}}rbios do sono parecem ser os sintomas mais comuns nesses pacientes. O objetivo deste estudo foi examinar a preval{\^{e}}ncia de sintomas em pacientes com c{\^{a}}ncer de pulm{\~{a}}o a fim de identificar subgrupos (clusters) de pacientes, agrupados de acordo com a magnitude dos sintomas, bem como comparar os subgrupos quanto {\`{a}} qualidade de vida. M{\'{E}}TODOS: Estudo transversal utilizando agrupamento hier{\'{a}}rquico aglomerativo. Foram avaliadas as caracter{\'{i}}sticas demogr{\'{a}}ficas de 50 pacientes com c{\^{a}}ncer de pulm{\~{a}}o, bem como sua pontua{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o em tr{\^{e}}s question{\'{a}}rios de qualidade de vida: o 30-item European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), o Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung e o Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-form Survey. A an{\'{a}}lise de agrupamentos (clusters) levou em conta a magnitude dos sintomas de maior preval{\^{e}}ncia de acordo com as escalas de sintomas do EORTC QLQC-30; esses sintomas foram fadiga, dor, dispneia e ins{\^{o}}nia. RESULTADOS: Foram identificados tr{\^{e}}s agrupamentos (subgrupos) de pacientes, baseados na magnitude dos quatro sintomas mais prevalentes. Os tr{\^{e}}s subgrupos de pacientes foram os seguintes: pacientes com sintomas leves (n = 30; 60%); pacientes com sintomas moderados (n = 14; 28%) e pacientes com sintomas graves (n = 6; 12%). O subgrupo de pacientes com sintomas graves apresentou a pior qualidade de vida, conforme mensurada pelos escores totais e pelas dimens{\~{o}}es integradas dos tr{\^{e}}s instrumentos. CONCLUS{\~{O}}ES: Este estudo destaca a import{\^{a}}ncia da avalia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de agrupamentos de sintomas como uma ferramenta relevante para medir a qualidade de vida de pacientes com doen{\c{c}}as cr{\^{o}}nicas, como o c{\^{a}}ncer de pulm{\~{a}}o.},

abstract = {Context: The International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care developed a consensus-based definition of palliative care (PC) that focuses on the relief of serious health-related suffering, a concept put forward by the Lancet Commission Global Access to Palliative Care and Pain Relief. Objective: The main objective of this article is to present the research behind the new definition. Methods: The three-phased consensus process involved health care workers from countries in all income levels. In Phase 1, 38 PC experts evaluated the components of the World Health Organization definition and suggested new/revised ones. In Phase 2, 412 International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care members in 88 countries expressed their level of agreement with the suggested components. In Phase 3, using results from Phase 2, the expert panel developed the definition. Results: The consensus-based definition is as follows: Palliative care is the active holistic care of individuals across all ages with serious health-related suffering due to severe illness and especially of those near the end of life. It aims to improve the quality of life of patients, their families and their caregivers. The definition includes a number of bullet points with additional details as well as recommendations for governments to reduce barriers to PC. Conclusion: Participants had significantly different perceptions and interpretations of PC. The greatest challenge faced by the core group was trying to find a middle ground between those who think that PC is the relief of all suffering and those who believe that PC describes the care of those with a very limited remaining life span.},

Methods: This was a bibliometric review using MEDLINE; EMBASE; Web Of Science; LILACS and the Cochrane Library. A search was conducted with the terms Barriers, Palliative Care and Cancer. Articles whose objectives targeted barriers to access to PC were considered, regardless of the year of publication. The setting is articles published from 1987 to 2020. Results: A total of 6158 articles were identified, of which 217 were eligible for analysis. The USA and UK being the countries with the largest number of articles on the subject (n=101, n=18, respectively). After expert analysis, the barriers were grouped into nine categories. Conclusions: Barriers related to symptom control were identified in 19% of the eligible articles, along with barriers related to health, which with 24% of occurrence in the articles, were the most frequently cited barriers. Countries which have implemented PC for some time were those with the greatest number of publications and in journals with the highest impact factors.

abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to identify the time intervals between the demand for health services and the initiation of cancer treatment, and to explore the associated factors, in gastric cancer patients being treated in an oncology hospital in northern Brazil. Methods: This cross-sectional study. Gastric cancer patients receiving treatment in a northern Brazil reference hospital were interviewed. A Mann-Whitney test was used to verify associations between the time intervals of access to treatment and socioeconomic factors, clinical variables, and patient difficulties, adopting a 0.05 significance level. Results: The average time intervals were 471.3 days between symptom onset and primary health service request and 180.9 days between diagnosis and treatment. The average time between the onset of symptoms and the treatment of gastric cancer was 747.8 days. Patients using herbal home remedies showed the longest times before seeking primary health care (p = 0.04). Delays between diagnosis and treatment were associated with unemployment (p = 0.03). High average times until oncologist appointments were related to the absence of comorbidities (p = 0.004). Personal difficulties and a lack of hospital beds were associated with long time intervals to specialist appointments and between diagnosis and treatment. Personal difficulties were associated with long time intervals between the onset of symptoms and the treatment of gastric cancer. Conclusion: Gastric cancer patients faced delays and healthcare access barriers in a region with high mortality for this disease. Appropriate interventions are necessary to reduce delays and better control the disease. Policy Summary: In this paper we have explored the barriers to access to diagnosis and treatment for patients with gastric cancer in a major cancer centre in Northern Brazil. The results will inform strategies for improving timely access to critical cancer services.},

abstract = {Context: Progress in palliative care (PC) necessarily involves scientific development. However, research conducted in South America (SA) needs to be improved. Objectives: To develop a set of recommendations to advance PC research in SA. Methods: Eighteen international PC experts participated in a Delphi study. In round one, items were developed (open-ended questions); in round two, each expert scored the importance of each item (from 0 to 10); in round three, they selected the 20 most relevant items. Throughout the rounds, the five main priority themes for research in SA were defined. In Round three, consensus was defined as an agreement of ≥75%. Results: 60 potential suggestions for overcoming research barriers in PC were developed in round one. Also in Round one, 88.2% (15 of 17) of the experts agreed to define a priority research agenda. In Round two, the 36 most relevant suggestions were defined and a new one added. Potential research priorities were investigated (open-ended). In Round three, from the 37 items, 10 were considered the most important. Regarding research priorities, symptom control, PC in primary care, public policies, education and prognosis were defined as the most relevant. Conclusion: Potential strategies to improve scientific research on PC in SA were defined, including stimulating the formation of collaborative research networks, offering courses and workshops on research, structuring centers with infrastructure resources and trained researchers, and lobbying governmental organizations to convince about the importance of palliative care. In addition, priority research topics were identified in the region.},

abstract = {Context: Religiosity/spirituality/religious-spiritual coping (RS) are resources used by cancer patients with cancer to help cope with the disease and may influence the preference and receipt of end-of-life (EOL) treatment. Objectives: To examine the relationship between RS and the EOL care preferred or received by cancer patients. Methods: This review protocol is registered on (International Prospective Register of Systematic Review, CRD42021251833) and follows the recommendations of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses checklist. Embase, Proquest, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were consulted. Google Scholar was consulted for additional publications and gray literature. Quantitative studies including adults with any cancer type/stage were eligible. The paper selection was performed by two independent reviewers; the methodological quality was measured using the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Results: Seventeen studies were included in the review. In general, RS is related to the preference or receipt of aggressive EOL care and with less advance care planning. Spiritual care by the medical team is related to higher referral to hospice and less aggressive care; in contrast, high spiritual support from religious communities is associated with less hospice and more aggressive care. Religious denominations influenced health care preferences, as Catholics were less likely to sign a do-not-resuscitate order and Buddhists or Taoists received more aggressive interventions at the EOL. Most studies (70%) were of high quality according to the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Conclusion: RS is associated with more aggressive EOL treatments, as well as with lower rates of ACP in cancer patients. On the other hand, spiritual care provided by the medical team seems to be associated with less aggressive EOL care.},

abstract = {Purpose: Hospital-based palliative care teams (HPCTs) are widespread internationally, but multicenter studies about their effectiveness, using patient-reported outcomes (PROs), are limited to Australia and a few other countries. We conducted a multicenter, prospective observational study in Japan to explore the effectiveness of the HPCTs using PROs. Methods: Nationwide, eight hospitals participated in the study. We included newly referred patients for one month in 2021 and followed them for one month. We asked the patients to complete the Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale or the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System as PROs at the time of the intervention, three days later, and weekly after the intervention. Results: A total of 318 participants were enrolled, of whom 86% were patients with cancer, 56% were undergoing cancer treatment, and 20% received the Best Supportive Care. After one week, the following 12 symptoms showed more than a 60% improvement from severe to moderate or less: vomiting (100%), shortness of breath (86%), nausea (83%), practical problems (80%), drowsiness (76%), pain (72%), poor sharing of feelings with family or friends (72%), weakness (71%), constipation (69%), not feeling at peace (64%), lack of information (63%), and sore or dry mouth (61%). Symptoms with improvement from severe/moderate to mild or less were vomiting (71%) and practical problems (68%). Conclusion: This multicenter study showed that HPCTs effectively improved symptoms in several severe conditions, as assessed by PROs. This study also demonstrated the difficulty of relieving symptoms in patients in palliative care and the need for improved care.},

abstract = {Purpose: Guidelines recommend a structured symptom screening (SC) for especially advanced cancer patients (CPs). The aim of this multicenter German prospective quality assurance project KeSBa (Kennzahl Symptom- und Belastungserfassung) was to gain knowledge on SC procedures in Oncology Centers (OCs) for advanced cancer patients and a first impression on the consequences of SC. Methods: The KeSBa project consisted of three phases: pilot, 3 months screening and feedback phase. Participating OCs decided to use either the Minimal Documentation System (MIDOS) or the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS) and defined the cutoff values for positive screening results. Results: Out of 172 certified German OCs, 40 (23%) participated in the KeSBa pilot phase, 29 (16.8%) in the 3 months screening phase using MIDOS (n = 18, 58.6%) or IPOS (n = 11, 41.3%) and in the feedback round. 25/29 performed paper-based screening (86.2%). 2.963 CPs were screened. Results were documented for 1255 (42.2%, SC +) positive and 874 (29.5%, SC–) negative screenings depending on the center´s schedules: 452 SC + CPs (28.4%) and 42 SC– CPs (2.6%) had contact to specialized palliative care or other supportive specialist teams afterwards, 458 SC + CPs (28.8%) and 605 SC– CPs (38.1%) remained in standard oncology care. In the feedback round missing resources (personal and IT) and improved communication were mentioned most often. Conclusion: Routine SC is feasible in advanced CPs treated in OCs but associated with considerable workload. In 42.2% of CPs SC was classified as positive, indicating the need of further diagnostics or professional judgment. SC requires staff and IT resources.},

abstract = {Much biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. 18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the Web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

abstract = {Context: The Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS) is a widely used outcome measure in palliative care research, and has good psychometric properties. It has been used for clinical or research purposes in specialist cancer centers, nursing homes, day hospice units, and hospice settings in a growing number of countries. However, the POS has not yet been examined using factor analysis. Objective: The aim of the present study was to examine the internal factor structure of the POS. Methods: Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were used for secondary analysis of two existing POS data sets of British patients, most of whom were cancer patients. Results: We began with a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which indicated that the POS is not a unidimensional scale. This was followed by an exploratory factor analysis that suggested two factors - one reflecting a psychological well-being dimension and the other consisting of three items relating to the standard of professional care. A similar two-factor structure also was identified in the second sample using CFA. Conclusion: The POS appears to capture two factors, psychological status and quality of care, and to have three items that function independently (family anxiety, symptoms, and pain control). Our findings suggest that future evaluations of palliative care services should include assessment not only of symptoms and well-being or quality of life, but also of quality of care, and that unidimensional measures will not capture all relevant aspects in palliative care. {\textcopyright} 2010 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This guideline presents an update to the 2013 American College of Gastroenterology Guideline on the Diagnosis and Management of Celiac Disease with updated recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with celiac disease (CD). CD is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. CD has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that resemble a multisystemic disorder rather than an isolated intestinal disease, and is characterized by small bowel injury and the presence of specific antibodies. Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g., tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis. A nonbiopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Current treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up. Most patients have excellent clinical response to a GFD. Nonresponsive CD is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms despite being on a GFD. These patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent or recurrent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination. Refractory CD is a rare cause of nonresponsive CD often associated with poor prognosis.},

abstract = {Background. Celiac disease (CD) is a genetically determined immune-mediated disorder in which gluten immunogenic peptides are presented to CD4 T cells by HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, DQ2.2, and their combinations. Our aim is to establish a risk gradient for celiac disease based on HLA-DQ profile in a brazilian representative population and the relevance of DQ2.2 in celiac disease development. Materials and Methods. 237 celiac patients and 237 controls (both groups with 164 females and 73 males) were included. All samples were tested for the presence of predisposing HLA-DQ alleles using the PCR-SSP method. Results were considered significant when p<0.05. Disease risk was expressed as 1: N for each HLA-DQ category described at this study. Results. DQ2.5 and/or DQ8 were detected in 224 celiac patients (94.5%) and 84 controls (35.4%). Eight celiac patients (3.4%) and 38 controls (16%) disclosed only DQ2.2. Even though DQ2.2 ($\beta$2/$\beta$2 or $\beta$2/x) showed a low CD risk of 1: 251 and 1: 550, respectively, the genotype DQ2.5/DQ2.2 ($\beta$2/$\beta$2) showed high CD risk of 1: 10 (p<0.0001). The disease risk gradient ranged from 1: 3014 to 1: 7. Conclusion. Our study allowed the determination of a risk gradient for celiac disease development in at-risk population, showing that DQ2.2 variant was relevant when associated with DQ2.5.},

abstract = {Background - Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Genetic susceptibility is associated with two sets of alleles, DQA1*05 - DQB1*02 and DQA1*03 - DQB1*03:02, which code for class II MHC DQ2 and DQ8 molecules, respectively. Approximately 90%-95% of celiac patients are HLA-DQ2 positive, and half of the remaining patients are HLA-DQ8 positive. In fact, during a celiac disease diagnostic workup, the absence of these specific DQA and DQB alleles has a near perfect negative predictive value. Objective - Improve the detection of celiac disease predisposing alleles by combining the simplicity and sensitivity of real-time PCR (qPCR) and melting curve analysis with the specificity of sequence-specific primers (SSP). Methods - Amplifications of sequence-specific primers for DQA1*05 (DQ2), DQB1*02 (DQ2), and DQA1*03 (DQ8) were performed by the real time PCR method to determine the presence of each allele in independent reactions. Primers for Human Growth Hormone were used as an internal control. A parallel PCR-SSP protocol was used as a reference method to validate our results. Results - Both techniques yielded equal results. From a total of 329 samples the presence of HLA predisposing alleles was determined in 187 (56.8%). One hundred fourteen samples (61%) were positive for a single allele, 68 (36.3%) for two alleles, and only 5 (2.7%) for three alleles. Conclusion - Results obtained by qPCR technique were highly reliable with no discordant results when compared with those obtained using PCR-SSP.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The basis of all statistical inference is probability and in order to understand ideas such as confidence intervals and significance tests, a basic understanding of probability is necessary. From a statistical perspective, what is important is the scale of measurement. Statisticians generally recognise three types of scale: qualitative, ordinal and quantitative. There are two principal forms of medical statistics: descriptive and inferential. The purpose of descriptive statistics is to give a description of the data that have been collected, whether from a clinical trial, epidemiological investigation or survey. Inferential statistics is aimed at making probability-based statements about hypotheses, parameters of populations, etc. The chapter also presents a discussion on the uses of meta-analysis and explains its strengths and weaknesses. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Statistics in Medicine, Fourth Edition, helps medical and biomedical investigators design and answer questions about analyzing and interpreting data and predicting the sample size required to achieve useful results. It makes medical statistics easy for the non-biostatistician by outlining common methods used in 90% of medical research. The text covers how to plan studies from conception to publication, what to do with data, and follows with step-by-step instructions for biostatistical methods from the simplest levels, to more sophisticated methods now used in medical articles. Examples from almost every medical specialty, and from dentistry, nursing, pharmacy and health care management are provided. This book does not require background knowledge of statistics or mathematics beyond high school algebra and provides abundant clinical examples and exercises to reinforce concepts. It is a valuable source for biomedical researchers, healthcare providers and anyone who conducts research or quality improvement projects.},

abstract = {In observational studies, the first step is usually to explore data distribution and the baseline differences between groups. Data description includes their central tendency (e.g., mean, median, and mode) and dispersion (e.g., standard deviation, range, interquartile range). There are varieties of bivariate statistical inference methods such as Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test, for normal, skews and categorical data, respectively. The article shows how to perform these analyses with R codes. Furthermore, I believe that the automation of the whole workflow is of paramount importance in that (I) it allows for others to repeat your results; (II) you can easily find out how you performed analysis during revision; (III) it spares data input by hand and is less error-prone; and (IV) when you correct your original dataset, the final result can be automatically corrected by executing the codes. Therefore, the process of making a publication quality table incorporating all abovementioned statistics and P values is provided, allowing readers to customize these codes to their own needs.},

@article{Verhulst2021,
abstract = {The measurement of many human traits, states, and disorders begins with a set of items on a questionnaire. The response format for these questions is often simply binary (e.g., yes/no) or ordered (e.g., high, medium or low). During data analysis, these items are frequently summed or used to estimate factor scores. In clinical applications, such assessments are often non-normally distributed in the general population because many respondents are unaffected, and therefore asymptomatic. As a result, in many cases these measures violate the statistical assumptions required for subsequent analyses. To reduce the influence of the non-normality and quasi-continuous assessment, variables are frequently recoded into binary (affected–unaffected) or ordinal (mild–moderate–severe) diagnoses. Ordinal data therefore present challenges at multiple levels of analysis. Categorizing continuous variables into ordered categories typically results in a loss of statistical power, which represents an incentive to the data analyst to assume that the data are normally distributed, even when they are not. Despite prior zeitgeists suggesting that, e.g., variables with more than 10 ordered categories may be regarded as continuous and analyzed as if they were, we show via simulation studies that this is not generally the case. In particular, using Pearson product-moment correlations instead of maximum likelihood estimates of polychoric correlations biases the estimated correlations towards zero. This bias is especially severe when a plurality of the observations fall into a single observed category, such as a score of zero. By contrast, estimating the ordinal correlation by maximum likelihood yields no estimation bias, although standard errors are (appropriately) larger. We also illustrate how odds ratios depend critically on the proportion or prevalence of affected individuals in the population, and therefore are sub-optimal for studies where comparisons of association metrics are needed. Finally, we extend these analyses to the classical twin model and demonstrate that treating binary data as continuous will underestimate genetic and common environmental variance components, and overestimate unique environment (residual) variance. These biases increase as prevalence declines. While modeling ordinal data appropriately may be more computationally intensive and time consuming, failing to do so will likely yield biased correlations and biased parameter estimates from modeling them.},

abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to review the presentation and analysis of ordinal data in three international nursing journals in 2003. Method: In total, 166 full-length articles from the 2003 editions of Cancer Nursing, Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences and Nursing Research were reviewed for their use of ordinal data. Results: This review showed that ordinal scales were used in about a third of the articles. However, only about half of the articles that used ordinal data had appropriate data presentation and only about half of the analyses of the ordinal data were performed properly. Conclusions: Ordinal data are rather common in nursing research, but a large share of the studies do not present/ analyse the result properly. Incorrect presentation and analysis of the data may lead to bias and reduced ability to detect statistical differences or effects, resulting in misleading information. This highlights the importance of knowledge about data level, and underlying assumptions for the statistical tests must be considered to ensure correct presentation and analyses of data. {\textcopyright} 2004 Nordic College of Caring Sciences.},

Methods: We illustrate special techniques for analyzing survival times by applying them to a publication on the treatment of patients with brain tumors. The present article is based on textbooks of statistics, a selective review of the literature, and the authors' own experience. Results: Survival times are analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method, which yields two measures of interest: survival rates and the median survival time. The log-rank test is used to compare survival times across treatment groups. Cox regression is used in multivariable models. The hazard ratio, a descriptive measure for differences in survival times, is explained. Conclusion: If survival times are analyzed without the use of special techniques, or if the underlying assumptions are not taken into account, faulty interpretation may result. Readers of scientific publications should know these pitfalls and be able to judge for themselves whether the chosen analytical method is correct.},

abstract = {Background: When reading reports of medical research findings, one is usually confronted with p-values. Publications typically contain not just one p-value, but an abundance of them, mostly accompanied by the word "significant." This article is intended to help readers understand the problem of multiple p-values and how to deal with it. Methods: When multiple p-values appear in a single study, this is usually because of multiple testing. A number of valid approaches are presented for dealing with the problem. This article is based on classical statistical methods as presented in many textbooks and on selected specialized literature. Results: Conclusions from publications with many "significant" results should be judged with caution if the authors have not taken adequate steps to correct for multiple testing. Researchers should define the goal of their study clearly at the outset and, if possible, define a single primary endpoint a priori. If the study is of an exploratory or hypothesis-generating nature, it should be clearly stated that any positive results might be due to chance and will need to be confirmed in further targeted studies. Conclusions: It is recommended that the word "significant" be used and interpreted with care. Readers should assess articles critically with regard to the problem of multiple testing. Authors should state the number of tests that were performed. Scientific articles should be judged on their scientific merit rather than by the number of times they contain the word "significant.".},

abstract = {Background: In this article, we discuss the purpose of sample size calculation in clinical trials, the need for it, and the methods by which it is accomplished. Study samples that are either too small or too large are unacceptable, for clinical, methodological, and ethical reasons. The physicians participating in clinical trials should be directly involved in sample size planning, because their expertise and knowledge of the literature are indispensable. Methods: We explain the process of sample size calculation on the basis of articles retrieved by a selecitve search of the international literature, as well as our own experience. Results: We present a fictitious clinical trial in which two antihypertensive agents are to be compared to each other with a t-test and then show how the appropriate size of the study sample should be calculated. Next, we describe the general principles of sample size calculation that apply when any kind of statistical test is to be used. We give further illustrative examples and explain what types of expert medical knowledge and assumptions are needed to calculate the appropriate sample size for each. These generally depend on the particular statistical test that is to be performed. Conclusion: In any clinical trial, the sample size has to be planned on a justifiable, rational basis. The purpose of sample size calculation is to determine the optimal number of participants (patients) to be included in the trial. Sample size calculation requires the collaboration of experienced biostatisticians and physician-researchers: expert medical knowledge is an essential part of it.},

abstract = {Background: The early detection of cancer and other diseases is generally considered beneficial, yet there is evidence that in some diseases screening may be of limited benefit. To clarify this issue, we present the statistical principles that underlie screening. Methods: We define screening and discuss the conditions for its successful use. We give illustrative examples from among the currently recommended types of screening in Germany and from the recent medical literature, particularly with regard to mammography. Results: Certain specific conditions must be fulfilled for screening to be beneficial (usually measured by reduced mortality): The screening procedure must be of high quality, and the screening intervals must be well adapted to the distribution of the sojourn time. Alongside its benefits, screening can also cause harm, particularly to the many patients who are given a false positive test result. According to German law, potential participants are entitled to being given all information necessary to make an informed decision about screening. Conclusion: Just like clinical interventions, screening programs should be evaluated before they are introduced or, at the latest, at the time of their introduction.},

abstract = {Background: In clinical research, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the best way to study the safety and efficacy of new treatments. RCTs are used to answer patientrelated questions and are required by governmental regulatory bodies as the basis for approval decisions. Methods: To help readers understand and evaluate RCTs, we discuss the methods and qualitative requirements of RCTs with reference to the literature and an illustrative case study. The discussion here corresponds to expositions of the subject that can be found in many textbooks but also reflects the authors' personal experience in planning, conducting and analyzing RCTs. Results: The quality of an RCT depends on an appropriate study question and study design, the prevention of systematic errors, and the use of proper analytical techniques. All of these aspects must be attended to in the planning, conductance, analysis, and reporting of RCTs. RCTs must also meet ethical and legal requirements. Conclusion: RCTs cannot yield reliable data unless they are planned, conducted, analyzed, and reported in ways that are methodologically sound and appropriate to the question being asked. The quality of any RCT must be critically evaluated before its relevance to patient care can be considered.},

@article{Gianicolo2020,
abstract = {Background: In clinical medical research, causality is demonstrated by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Often, however, an RCT cannot be conducted for ethical reasons, and sometimes for practical reasons as well. In such cases, knowledge can be derived from an observational study instead. In this article, we present two methods that have not been widely used in medical research to date. Methods: The methods of assessing causal inferences in observational studies are described on the basis of publications retrieved by a selective literature search. Results: Two relatively new approaches-regression-discontinuity methods and interrupted time series-can be used to demonstrate a causal relationship under certain circumstances. The regression-discontinuity design is a quasi-experimental approach that can be applied if a continuous assignment variable is used with a threshold value. Patients are assigned to different treatment schemes on the basis of the threshold value. For assignment variables that are subject to random measurement error, it is assumed that, in a small interval around a threshold value, e.g., cholesterol values of 160 mg/dL, subjects are assigned essentially at random to one of two treatment groups. If patients with a value above the threshold are given a certain treatment, those with values below the threshold can serve as control group. Interrupted time series are a special type of regression-discontinuity design in which time is the assignment variable, and the threshold is a cutoff point. This is often an external event, such as the imposition of a smoking ban. A before-and-after comparison can be used to determine the effect of the intervention (e.g., the smoking ban) on health parameters such as the frequency of cardiovascular disease. Conclusion: The approaches described here can be used to derive causal inferences from observational studies. They should only be applied after the prerequisites for their use have been carefully checked.},

Results: Methods of comparing different measuring or rating techniques are of two kinds: those with a nominal rating scale and those with a continuous rating scale. We only discuss methods for comparing one measuring or rating technique with another one. Moreover, we point out some common erroneous approaches to concordance analysis.

Methods: Using a selection of international literature, the reader is introduced to the principles of critical reading of scientific articles in medicine. For the sake of conciseness, detailed description of statistical methods is omitted. Results: Widely accepted principles for critically appraising scientific articles are outlined. Basic knowledge of study design, structuring of an article, the role of different sections, of statistical presentations as well as sources of error and limitation are presented. The reader does not require extensive methodological knowledge. As far as necessary for critical appraisal of scientific articles, differences in research areas like epidemiology, clinical, and basic research are outlined. Further useful references are presented.

Methods: Some of the more important problems affecting observational studies are described and illustrated by examples. Additional information is provided with reference to a selection of the literature. Results: Factors that may bias the results of observational studies can be broadly categorized as: selection bias resulting from the way study subjects are recruited or from differing rates of study participation depending on the subjects' cultural background, age, or socioeconomic status, information bias, measurement error, confounders, and further factors. Conclusions: Observational studies make an important contribution to medical knowledge. The main methodological problems can be avoided by careful study planning.

@article{Sauerbrei2009,
abstract = {Background: The findings of epidemiological studies, diagnostic tests, and comparative therapeutic trials are often presented in 2 x 2 tables. These must be interpreted correctly for a proper understanding of the findings. Methods: The authors present basic statistical concepts required for the analysis of nominal data, referring to standard works in statistics. Results: The relative risk and odds ratio are defined to be indices for the relationship between two binary quantities (e.g., exposure - yes/no and disease - yes/no). The topics dealt with in this article include the effect of sample size on the length of the confidence interval and the p-value, and also inaccuracies caused by measuring error. Exposures are often expressed on a three-level scale (none, low, high). The authors also consider the 2x3 table as an extension of the 2 x 2 table and discuss the categorization of continuous measurements. Typically, more than one factor is involved in the development of a disease. The effect that a further factor can have on the observed relationship be tween the exposure and the disease is discussed. Conclusions: Sample size, measurement error, categorization, and confounders influence the statistical interpretation of 2 x 2 tables in many ways. Readers of scientific publications should know the inherent problems in the interpretation of simple 2x2 tables and check that the authors have taken these into account adequately in analyzing and interpreting their data.},

abstract = {Background: Clinical trials are of central importance for the evaluation and comparison of treatments. The transparency and intelligibility of the treatment effect under investigation is an essential matter for physicians, patients, and health-care authorities. The estimand framework has been introduced because many trials are deficient in this respect. Methods: Introduction, definition, and application of the estimand framework on the basis of an example and a selective review of the literature. Results: The estimand framework provides a systematic approach to the definition of the treatment effect under investigation in a clinical trial. An estimand consists of five attributes: treatment, population, variable, population-level summary, and handling of intercurrent events. Each of these attributes is defined in an interdisciplinary discussion during the trial planning phase, based on the clinical question being asked. Special attention is given to the handling of intercurrent events (ICEs): these are events - e.g., discontinuation or modification of treatment or the use of emergency medication - that can occur once the treatment has begun and might affect the possibility of observing the endpoints or their interpretability. There are various strategies for the handling of ICEs; these can, for example, also reflect the existing intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Per-protocol analyses, in contrast, are prone to bias and cannot be represented in a sensible manner by an estimand, although they may be performed as a supplementary analysis. The discussion of potential intercurrent events and how they should appropriately be handled in view of the aim of the trial must already take place in the planning phase. Conclusion: Use of the estimand framework should make it easier for both physicians and patients to understand what trials reveal about the efficacy of treatment, and to compare the results of different trials.},

abstract = {Background: An increasing number of clinical trials are being performed to show the absence of relevant differences between the effects of two treatments. The primary care physician makes use of the results of so-called equivalence studies, at least indirectly, practically every day. Equally important are active control clinical trials in which the efficacy of a new treatment has to be proven through demonstrating non-inferiority as compared to a standard treatment. Methods: Explanation of basic principles and statistical techniques with reference to the original literature; selective searches in the medical literature. Results: First of all, a suitable distributional parameter must be chosen that can be considered a reasonable measure of dissimilarity of the population effects of the treatments under comparison. The simplest approach to the statistical demonstration of equivalence or noninferiority is to calculate confidence intervals for that parameter. To keep the required number of subjects for equivalence and non-inferiority studies as low as possible, statistical tests should be used which are optimized with respect to power. Conclusion: Data from equivalence and non-inferiority studies need to be assessed for statistical significance no less than data that are generated to show that two treatments have different effects. A negative result in a traditional two-sided test does not suffice for statistically proving equivalence.},

Different regression models will be presented as examples of complex analytical methods. Results: Important frequency measures in cohort studies are incidence and mortality. Important effect measures such as the relative risk (RR), hazard ratio (HR), standardized incidence ratio (SIR), standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and odds ratio (OR) can also be calculated. In case-control or cross-sectional studies, the OR can be calculated as an effect measure. In cross-sectional studies, prevalence is the most important frequency measure. The interpretation of different frequency measures and effect measures will be discussed.

Methods: Statistical variables in medicine may be of either the metric (continuous, quantitative) or categorical (nominal, ordinal) type. Easily understandable examples are given. Basic techniques for the statistical description of collected data are presented and illustrated with examples. Results: The goal of a scientific study must always be clearly defined. The definition of the target value or clinical endpoint determines the level of measurement of the variables in question. Nearly all variables, whatever their level of measurement, can be usefully presented graphically and numerically. The level of measurement determines what types of diagrams and statistical values are appropriate. There are also different ways of presenting combinations of two independent variables graphically and numerically. Conclusions: The description of collected data is indispensable. If the data are of good quality, valid and important conclusions can already be drawn when they are properly described. Furthermore, data description provides a basis for inferential statistics.},

Methods: Introduction of Bayes' theorem and discussion of its implications for laboratory test results in a mostly non-technical form, accompanied by a selective literature review. Results and conclusions: According to Bayes' theorem the positive predictive value of laboratory test results is directly dependent on the prevalence of the disease in a given patient cohort. Thus, the clinical value of a given test result is critically dependent on a precise indication. Ordering of tests that are not indicated in a given patient is clinically useless and undesirable, where detailed information on disease prevalence is missing. These considerations are valid irrespective of ethical or economic considerations.},

abstract = {Many clinical trials have a crossover design. Certain considerations that are relevant to the crossover design, but play no role in standard parallel-group trials, must receive adequate attention in trial planning and data analysis for the results to be of scientific value. Methods: The authors present the basic statistical methods required for the analysis of crossover trials, referring to standard statistical texts. Results: In the simplest and most common scenario, a crossover trial involves two treatments which are consecutively administered in each patient recruited in the study. The main purpose served by the design is to provide a basis for separating treatment effects from period effects. This is achieved via computing the treatment effects separately in two sequence groups formed via random ization. The differences between treatment effects can be assessed by means of a standard t-test for independent samples using the intra-individual differences between the outcomes in both periods as the raw data. The exis - tence of carryover effects must be ruled out for this method to be valid. This assumption is usually checked using a pre-test, which is also described in this article. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of nonparametric tests instead of t-tests and more complicated designs with more than two test periods and/or treatments. Conclusion: Crossover trials in which the results are not analyzed separately by sequence group are of limited, if any, scientific value. It is also essential to guard against carryover effects. Whenever ignoring such effects proves un - justified, the treatment effect must be analyzed solely via an analysis of the data obtained during the first trial period. Even the use of this restricted dataset yields results whose validity is not beyond question.},

The study design and consequent study type are major determinants of a study's scientific quality and clinical value. Methods: This article describes the structured classification of studies into two types, primary and secondary, as well as a further subclassification of studies of primary type. This is done on the basis of a selective literature search concerning study types in medical research, in addition to the authors' own experience. Results: Three main areas of medical research can be distinguished by study type: basic (experimental), clinical, and epidemiological research. Furthermore, clinical and epidemiological studies can be further subclassified as either interventional or noninterventional. Conclusions: The study type that can best answer the particular research question at hand must be determined not only on a purely scientific basis, but also in view of the available financial resources, staffing, and practical feasibility (organization, medical prerequisites, number of patients, etc.).},

It is generally accepted that AIS is a multifactorial disease controlled by genetic, hormonal, neuromuscular, and environmental factors. Herein, we describe a case of 12‑year‑old scoliotic girl with a double curve of initially 26° thoracic and 23° lumbar, seeking chiropractic care. The therapy was provided three times/twice a week for 6 months. Adjustments of the spine through chiropractic, both soreness and mobility, were shown to improve. A total correction in Cobb angle of 6° (23%) in the thoracic curve and 7° (30%) in the lumbar curve was illustrated on consequent radiographs. This case highlights the advantage of chiropractic adjustment of early scoliosis primarily because the medical community does not offer any treatment for such a mild scoliosis. Further, randomized trial is warranted to support this viability for AIS. Keywords:},

abstract = {Background: The findings of observational studies can be distorted by a number of factors. So-called confounders are well known, but distortion by collider bias (CB) has received little attention in medical research to date. The goal of this article is to present the principle of CB, and measures that can be taken to avoid it, by way of a few illustrative examples. Methods: The findings of a selective review of the literature on CB are explained with illustrative examples. Results: The simplest case of a collider variable is one that is caused by at least two other variables. An example of CB is the observation that, among persons with diabetes, obesity is associated with lower mortality, even though it is associated with higher mortality in the general population. The false protective association between obesity and mortality arises from the restriction of the study population to persons with diabetes. Conclusion: CB is a distortion that arises through restriction on or stratification by a collider variable, or through statistical adjustment for a collider variable in a regression model. CB can arise in many ways. The graphic representation of causal structures helps to identify potential sources of CB. It is important to distinguish confounders from colliders, as methods that serve to correct for confounding can themselves cause bias when applied to colliders. There is no generally applicable method for correcting CB.},

abstract = {Background: Outcomes are recognised the most valid way to understand people's needs, monitor change and determine the results of treatment and care. We aimed to refine and validate the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale (IPOS), a measure underpinned by extensive development work over the last 15 years, in terms of its construct validity, reliability and longitudinal responsiveness to change. Methods: Concurrent, cross-cultural validation study of two versions of IPOS - i) patient self-report and ii) staff proxy-report - in a multicentre longitudinal survey in hospice in-patient units, hospitals, and community (homebased) settings in the UK and in Germany. Validation comprised: cognitive testing & item adaptation, internal consistency, agreement, structural validity, known-group comparisons, correlational analysis, and longitudinal evaluation in form of test-retest reliability and responsiveness to change. Results: 373 patients and 161 staff members were recruited. The final 19 item version showed very good internal consistency ($\alpha$ = 0.77) and good test-retest reliability as well as patient-staff and staff-staff agreement on most items. A three-factor structure (physical symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, emotional concerns) was confirmed. The IPOS and its subscales showed a strong ability to distinguish between clinically relevant groups (total IPOS and IPOS subscale scores being higher in those patients with unstable or deteriorating disease vs. stable disease, F=11.1, p< 0.001). Excellent convergent and discriminant validity to hypothesised items and subscales of the ESAS and the FACT-G was demonstrated. Longitudinal validity in form of responsiveness to change was good. Conclusions: The IPOS is a valid and reliable outcome measures, both in its patient and staff version. It is suitable for assessing and monitoring palliative care outcomes in clinical practice and research.},

abstract = {Objectives: We aimed to determine for the first time the prevalence and severity of multidimensional problems in a population newly diagnosed with HIV at outpatient clinics in Africa. Methods: Recently diagnosed patients (within previous 14 days) were consecutively recruited at 11 HIV clinics in Kenya and Uganda. Participants completed a validated questionnaire, the African Palliative Outcome Scale (POS), with three underpinning factors. Ordinal logistic regression was used to evaluate risk factors for prevalence and severity of physical, psychological, interpersonal and existential problems. Results: There were 438 participants (62% female, 30% with restricted physical function). The most prevalent problems were lack of help and advice (47% reported none in the previous 3 days) and difficulty sharing feelings. Patients with limited physical function reported more physical/psychological (OR = 3.22) and existential problems (OR = 1.54) but fewer interpersonal problems (OR = 0.50). All outcomes were independent of CD4 count or ART eligibility. Conclusions: Patients at all disease stages report widespread and burdensome multidimensional problems at HIV diagnosis. Newly diagnosed patients should receive assessment and care for these problems. Effective management of problems at diagnosis may help to remove barriers to retention in care. {\textcopyright} 2013 Simms et al.},

Despite international policy explicitly stating that a multidimensional approach such as palliative care should be delivered throughout the disease trajectory and alongside treatment, the effectiveness of this approach has not been tested in ART-experienced populations.Methods/design: This mixed methods study uses a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) to test the null hypothesis that receipt of palliative care in addition to standard HIV care does not affect pain compared to standard care alone. An additional qualitative component will explore the mechanism of action and participant experience. The sample size is designed to detect a statistically significant decrease in reported pain, determined by a two tailed test and a p value of ≤0.05. Recruited patients will be adults on ART for more than one month, who report significant pain or symptoms which have lasted for more than two weeks (as measured by the African Palliative Care Association (APCA) African Palliative Outcome Scale (POS)). The intervention under trial is palliative care delivered by an existing HIV facility nurse trained to a set standard. Following an initial pilot the study will be delivered in two African countries, using two parallel independent Phase III clinical RCTs. Qualitative data will be collected from semi structured interviews and documentation from clinical encounters, to explore the experience of receiving palliative care in this context.Discussion: The data provided by this study will provide evidence to inform the improvement of outcomes for people living with HIV and on ART in Africa.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01608802. {\textcopyright} 2012 Lowther et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Context: Managing activities of daily living is important to people with advanced cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Understanding disability in activities of daily living may inform service planning. Objective: To identify the prevalence of disability in activities of daily living, associations and change over time, in older people with advanced cancer or COPD. Methods: Secondary analysis of International Access, Rights and Empowerment (IARE) studies in adults aged ≥65 years with advanced disease in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and United States, using cross-sectional (IARE I & II) and longitudinal (IARE II, 3 timepoints over 6 months) data. Measures included disability in activities of daily living (Barthel Index), symptom severity (Palliative Outcome Scale), and assistive device use (self-reported). Logistic regression was used to identify relationships between disability and age, sex, living alone, diagnosis, and symptom burden; visual graphical analysis explores individual disability trajectories. Results: One hundred fifty-nine participants were included (140 cancer, 19 COPD). Sixty-five percent had difficulty climbing stairs, 48% bathing, 39% dressing, and 36% mobilizing. Increased disability was independently associated with increased symptom burden (odds ratio, 1.08 [95% CI:1.02–1.15], P = 0.01) and walking unaided (z = 2.35, P = 0.02), but not with primary diagnosis (z = −0.47, P = 0.64). Disability generally increased over time but with wide interindividual variation. Conclusion: Disability in activities of daily living in advanced cancer or COPD is common, associated with increased symptom burden, and may be attenuated by use of assistive devices. Individual disability trajectories vary widely, with diverse disability profiles. Services should include rehabilitative interventions, guided by disability in individual activities of daily living.},

abstract = {Background: There is a dearth of data regarding the optimal method of detecting and treating depression in palliative care. This study applied the Delphi method to evaluate expert opinion on choice of screening tool, choice of antidepressant and choice of psychological therapy. The aim was to inform the development of best practice recommendations for the European Palliative Care Research Collaborative clinical practice guideline on managing depression in palliative care. Methods. 18 members of an international, multi-professional expert group completed a structured questionnaire in two rounds, rating their agreement with proposed items on a scale from 0-10 and annotating with additional comments. The median and range were calculated to give a statistical average of the experts' ratings. Results: There was contention regarding the benefits of screening, with 'routine informal asking' (median 8.5 (0-10)) rated more highly than formal screening tools such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (median 7.0 (1-10). Mirtazapine (median 9 (7-10) and citalopram (median 9 (5-10) were the considered the best choice of antidepressant and cognitive behavioural therapy (median 9.0 (3-10) the best choice of psychological therapy. Conclusions: The range of expert ratings was broad, indicating discordance in the views of experts. Direct comparative data from randomised controlled trials are needed to strengthen the evidence-base and achieve clarity on how best to detect and treat depression in this setting. {\textcopyright} 2011 Rayner et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Palliative care is rarely being offered to patients with Parkinson's disease. Aim: To assess symptom prevalence, severity and palliative care needs in advanced stages of Parkinsonism. Design: A cross-sectional survey using a palliative care assessment tool, the Palliative Outcome Scale was administered to patients. Setting/participants: Eight-two patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, multiple systems atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy were included in the study. Results: Their mean age and disease stages 3-5 Hoehn and Yahr were 67 years and 4.1, respectively. Patients reported a mean of 10.7 (standard deviation = 3.9) physical symptoms. Over 80% had pain, fatigue, day time somnolence and problems with mobility. Other symptoms in 50%-80% included constipation, loss of bladder control, swallowing difficulties, drooling, breathlessness and sleep problems. Symptoms rated as causing severe problems were pain, fatigue, constipation and drooling. Assessment of mood revealed 70% of the patients felt anxiety and 60% had felt depressed. Eight-five per cent felt their families were anxious or worried about them. Thirty-eight per cent would have liked more information and 42% had practical problems that still needed to be addressed. There was a positive correlation between number of symptoms and disease severity (r = 0.39, p = 0.01). The total mean Palliative Outcome Scale score was 13.6 (standard deviation = 6.1), suggesting moderate palliative care needs. Conclusion: This is the first study to describe the care needs of people with Parkinson's disease using the Palliative Outcome Scale tool. The burden of symptoms and concerns was high in advanced stages of disease. It might be appropriate that people severely affected by these conditions should be considered for referral to specialist palliative care services. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {Breathlessness is a distressing symptom in advanced disease. Little is known about the trajectories of this symptom over time and towards death. This study aimed to describe and compare the summary and individual trajectories of breathlessness and overall symptom burden over time and towards the end of life following patients with advanced cancer or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in inpatient and outpatient health care settings in Germany. The modified Borg Scale, Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Short Form and Palliative Outcome Scale were used as outcome measures. Data were collected at baseline and then monthly over six months or until death. Forty-nine cancer and 60 COPD patients were included. Both groups had similar demographics. Thirty out of the 49 cancer and 6/60 COPD patients died, 7/49 cancer and 20/60 COPD patients dropped out due to physical deterioration or questionnaire fatigue. In cancer patients, breathlessness increased towards death. In COPD patients, breathlessness increased over time. Twenty-one cancer and 43 COPD patients provided data for individual breathlessness trajectories. These revealed wide individual variations with four different patterns: fluctuation, increasing, stable and decreasing breathlessness. Symptom trajectories on the population level reflecting the whole group mask individual variation, which is reflected in distinct symptom trajectories with different patterns. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Background: Patients with incurable, progressive disease receiving palliative care in sub-Saharan Africa experience high levels of spiritual distress with a detrimental impact on their quality of life. Locally validated measurement tools are needed to identify patients' spiritual needs and evaluate and improve spiritual care, but up to now such tools have been lacking in Africa. The African Palliative Care Association (APCA) African Palliative Outcome Scale (POS) contains two items relating to peace and life worthwhile. We aimed to determine the content and construct validity of these items as measures of spiritual wellbeing in African palliative care populations.Methods: The study was conducted at five palliative care services, four in South Africa and one in Uganda. The mixed-methods study design involved: (1) cognitive interviews with 72 patients, analysed thematically to explore the items' content validity, and (2) quantitative data collection (n = 285 patients) using the POS and the Spirit 8 to assess construct validity.Results: (1) Peace was interpreted according to the themes 'perception of self and world', 'relationship to others', 'spiritual beliefs' and 'health and healthcare'. Life worthwhile was interpreted in relation to 'perception of self and world', 'relationship to others' and 'identity'. (2) Conceptual convergence and divergence were also evident in the quantitative data: there was moderate correlation between peace and Spirit 8 spiritual well-being (r = 0.46), but little correlation between life worthwhile and Spirit 8 spiritual well-being (r = 0.18) (both p < 0.001). Correlations with Spirit 8 items were weak to moderate. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate the utility of POS items peace and life worthwhile as distinct but related measures of spiritual well-being in African palliative care. Peace and life worthwhile are brief and simple enough to be integrated into routine practice and can be used to measure this important but neglected outcome in this population. {\textcopyright} 2013 Selman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Context: The incidence of life-limiting progressive disease in sub-Saharan Africa presents a significant clinical and public health challenge. The ability to easily measure patient outcomes is essential to improving care. Objectives: The present study aims to determine the specific factors (if any) that underpin the African Palliative Care Association African Palliative Outcome Scale to assist the analysis of data in routine clinical care and audit. Methods: Using self-reported data collected from patients with HIV infection in eastern and southern Africa, an exploratory factor analysis was undertaken with 1337 patients; subsequently, a confirmatory analysis was done on two samples from separate data sets (n = 445). Results: Using exploratory factor analysis initially, both two- and three-factor solutions were examined and found to meet the criteria for simple structure and be readily interpretable. Then using confirmatory factor analysis on two separate samples, the three-factor solution demonstrated better fit, with Goodness-of-Fit Index values greater than 0.95 and Normative Fit Index values close to 0.90. The resulting three factors were 1) physical and psychological well-being, 2) interpersonal well-being, and 3) existential well-being. Conclusion: This analysis presents an important new opportunity in the analysis of outcome data for patients with progressive disease. It has advantages over both the total scoring of multidimensional scaling (which masks differences between domains) and of item scoring (which requires repeated analyses). The three factors map well onto the underlying concept and clinical goals of palliative care, and will enable audit of facility care. {\textcopyright} 2013 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

abstract = {Background People with HIV accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART) have persistent physical, psychological, social, and spiritual problems, which are associated with poor quality of life and treatment outcomes. We assessed the eff ectiveness of a nurse-led palliative care intervention on patient-reported outcomes. Methods We did this randomised controlled trial at a clinic in Kenya for adults with HIV, established on ART, and reporting moderate-to-severe pain or symptoms. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) either to a palliative care intervention (including assessments of physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing and quality of life) given six times over 4 months, or to usual care. Participants and investigators were not masked to allocation. The primary outcome was pain (scored on the African Palliative Care Association's African Palliative Outcome Scale). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01608802. Findings We screened 2070 patients, of whom we enrolled 120: 60 allocated to each group. In the control group, median pain score improved from 1.0 (IQR 0.0-2.0) at baseline to 5.0 (3.0-5.0) at 4 months; in the intervention group, it improved from 1.0 (0.0-2.0) at baseline to 4.5 (3.0-5.0) at 4 months. Compared with standard care, the intervention had no signifi cant eff ect on pain (coeffi cient -0.01, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.34, p=0.95). Interpretation A nurse-led palliative care intervention was not eff ective in reducing pain. However, person-centred assessment and care delivered by staff who have received additional training had positive eff ects on self-reported mental health related quality of life and psychosocial wellbeing.},

abstract = {Background: Emerging trends and new policies suggest that more cancer patients might die at home in the future. However, not all have equal chances of achieving this. Furthermore, there is lack of evidence to support that those who die at home experience better care and a better death than those who die as inpatients. The QUALYCARE study aims to examine variations in the quality and costs of end-of-life care, preferences and palliative outcomes associated with dying at home or in an institution for cancer patients.Methods/Design: Mortality followback survey (with a nested case-control study of home vs. hospital deaths) conducted with bereaved relatives of cancer patients in four Primary Care Trusts in London. Potential participants are identified from death registrations and approached by the Office for National Statistics in complete confidence. Data are collected via a postal questionnaire to identify the informal and formal care received in the three months before death and the associated costs, relatives' satisfaction with care, and palliative outcomes for the patients and their relatives. A well-established questionnaire to measure relatives' views on the care integrates four brief and robust tools - the Client Service Receipt Inventory, the Palliative Outcome Scale, the EQ-5 D and the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief. Further questions assess patients and relatives' preferences for place of death. The survey aims to include 500 bereaved relatives (140 who experienced a home death, 205 a hospital death, 115 a hospice death and 40 a nursing home death). Bivariate and multivariate analyses will explore differences in place of death and place of end-of-life care, in preferences for place of death, patients' palliative outcomes and relatives' bereavement outcomes, in relation to place of death. Factors influencing death at home and the costs of end-of-life care by place of death will be identified.Discussion: Collecting data on end-of-life care retrospectively from bereaved relatives has ethical, practical and scientific challenges. QUALYCARE has been carefully designed to address these challenges in a robust and ethically sound population-based survey. By discovering variations in the underlying individual reality of place of death for people dying from cancer and their families, this study will advance our understanding of end-of-life care and, we hope, improve care for cancer patients and their families in the future.Trial registration: National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network Portfolio.

abstract = {Long-term neurological conditions (LTNCs) often cause debilitating symptoms. Better understanding of symptom dimensions in LTNCs is needed to support health professionals and improve care. This can be achieved by exploring the factor structure of a standardised measure of symptoms in LTNC patients. The symptom subscale of the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale for LTNCs (IPOS Neuro-S24) comprises 24 items measuring symptom severity. Descriptive statistics and psychometric properties of the scale were assessed, followed by differential item functioning (DIF), exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Data from N = 238 patients were analysed. The mean IPOS Neuro S-24 score was 27.0 (possible range 0-96) and floor effects were found for 21 items. The scale had good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.77). Weak evidence of DIF was found for nine items. All but one item (falls) loaded onto four factors with loadings > 0.3. The factors represented four clinically meaningful symptom dimensions: fatigue, motor symptoms, oral problems and non-motor symptoms. We identified a reliable four-factor structure of symptom experience in LTNC patients. The results suggest that symptom dimensions are common across LTNCs. The IPOS Neuro S-24 is an appropriate tool to measure symptoms in LTNC patients, which may improve care.},

abstract = {Background: Clinicians and researchers often have to rely on information from caregivers to assess patients with advanced cancer. This study aims to assess the validity (using patients' assessment as the gold standard) of caregiver reports of patient concerns and the roles of caregiver burden and positivity. Methods: A total of 64 advanced cancer patient and informal caregiver dyads were recruited from regional palliative care services and interviewed. Patients' outcomes were assessed with both the patient and the caregiver version of the Palliative Outcome Scale (POS); caregiver burden and positivity were collected with the Zarit Burden interview (ZBI) and three questions on achievements and relationships. The agreement between patient- and caregiver-rated POS was measured with weighted kappa statistics. The roles of caregiver burden and positivity in POS agreement were studied with logistic regression controlling for potential confounders; adjusted odds ratios were estimated from the models. Results: Agreement was substantial for pain, moderate for four items, fair for three items and slight for two items. Compared with patients self-ratings, caregivers described more problems with information given and sharing feelings and were less likely to assess the patient felt their life was worthwhile or felt good about themselves. Disagreement for three POS item ratings was significantly associated with higher caregiver burden: "feeling anxious"(OR: 4.5; 95%CI: 1.3 to 15.6), "life worthwhile"(OR: 12.4; 95%CI: 2.9 to 54.3) and "felt good" (OR: 7.7; 95%CI: 2.0 to 29.6). Caregivers with higher positivity scores were more likely to agree patients' rating of "felt good"(OR: 0.3; 95%CI: 0.1 - 0.9) but at increased risk of disagreeing about patient's "practical problems"(OR: 4.2; 95%CI: 1.1 to 16.6). Conclusion: Caregiver burden and positivity affect their assessments, especially of psychological patient domains and whether patients assess their life as worthwhile. Awareness of this might help clinicians and researchers better interpret caregiver assessments. {\textcopyright} 2008 Higginson and Gao; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Despite a high incidence of life-limiting disease, there is a deficit of palliative care outcome evidence in sub-Saharan Africa. Providers of end of life care call for appropriate measurement tools. The objective is to compare four approaches to self-report pain and symptom measurement among African palliative care patients completing the African Palliative Care Association African Palliative Outcome Scale (APCA African POS). Methods: Patients were recruited from five services (4 in South Africa and 1 in Uganda). Research nurses cross-sectionally administered POS pain and symptom items in local languages. Both questions were scored from 0 to 5 using 4 methods: verbal rating, demonstrating the score using the hand (H), selecting a face on a visual scale (F), and indicating a point on the Jerrycan visual scale (J). H, F and J scores were correlated with verbal scores as reference using Spearman's rank and weighted Kappa. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Results: 315 patients participated (mean age 43.5 years, 69.8% female), 71.1% were HIV positive and 35.6% had cancer, 49.2% lived in rural areas. Spearman's rank correlations for pain scores were: H: 0.879, F: 0.823, J: 0.728 (all p &#60; 0.001); for symptoms H: 0.876, F: 0.808, J: 0.721 (all p &#60; 0.001). Weighted Kappa for pain was H: 0.798, F: 0.719 J: 0.548 and for symptoms: H: 0.818, F: 0.718, J: 0.571. There was lower agreement between verbal and both hand and face scoring methods in the Ugandan sample. Compared to the verbal scale the accuracy of predicting high pain/symptoms was H > F > J (0.96-0.89) in ROC analysis. Conclusions: Hands and faces scoring methods correlate highly with verbal scoring. The Jerrycan method had only moderate weighted Kappa. POS scores can be reliably measured using hand or face score.},

abstract = {Context: Despite the need to accurately measure spiritual outcomes in diverse palliative care populations, little attention has been paid to the properties of the tools currently in use. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to appraise the psychometric properties, multifaith appropriateness, and completion time of spiritual outcome measures validated in multicultural advanced cancer, HIV, or palliative care populations. Methods: Eight databases were searched to identify relevant validation and research studies. A comprehensive search strategy included search terms in three categories: palliative care, spirituality, and outcome measurement. Inclusion criteria were: validated in advanced cancer, HIV, or palliative care populations and in an ethnically diverse context. Included tools were evaluated with respect to psychometric properties (validity, reproducibility, responsiveness, and interpretability), multifaith appropriateness, and time to complete. Results: A total of 191 articles were identified, yielding 85 tools. Twenty-six tools (representing four families of measures and five individual tools) met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-four tools demonstrated good content validity and 12 demonstrated adequate internal consistency. Only eight tools demonstrated adequate construct validity, usually because specific hypotheses were not stated and tested. Seven tools demonstrated adequate test-retest reliability; two tools showed adequate responsiveness, and two met the interpretability criterion. Data on the religious faith of the population of validation were available for 11 tools; of these, eight were tested in multifaith populations. Conclusion: Results suggest that, at present, the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire, the Measuring the Quality of Life of Seriously Ill Patients Questionnaire, and the Palliative Outcome Scale are the most appropriate multidimensional measures containing spiritual items for use in multicultural palliative care populations. However, none of these measures score perfectly on all psychometric criteria, and their multifaith appropriateness requires further testing. {\textcopyright} 2011 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee Published by Elsevier Inc.

The Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS) developed from earlier versions of this tool. Its use is encouraged to ameliorate the assessment of individual outcomes in palliative care settings. The previous version, named POS (Palliative care Outcome Scale) is now fully validated in Italian but needs to be updated to the IPOS version. This study aimed to translate and culturally adapt IPOS into Italian, and explore through cognitive testing its face and content validity. Methods: After forward-backward translation, a qualitative study explored the views of and cognitive processes used by respondents. We conducted individual semi structured interviews with 21 patients admitted to two palliative care services from hospitals, hospices and the community, and focus groups with 12 professionals working in multidisciplinary palliative care teams. The data was analysed using a thematic analysis approach. The results were integrated in a final audit, including the project team and the original POS developer, to refine the final format of the tool. Results: Patients and professionals felt content and format of IPOS appropriate and feasible, and not burdensome. Some layout problems were raised leading to adaptation. Main issues regarded: clarifying the meaning of choices and some cultural interpretation of some questions and response options and interpretation of some instructions. Some new terms were proposed since were felt as more appropriate and comprehensive in this cultural context, for example replacing the term “family” with beloved ones. The items that appeared unchanged from the Italian POS versions were left unmodified to maintain a coherence with the previously validated tool. Conclusions: The Italian IPOS, in its four versions directed to patients or staff and with a recall period of 3 or 7 days has face and content validity for use in clinical settings and is ready for further psychometric and clinimetric validation.},

abstract = {Background: Despite the burden of progressive incurable disease in Africa, there is almost no evidence on patient care or outcomes. A primary reason has been the lack of appropriate locally-validated outcome tools. This study aimed to validate a multidimensional scale (the APCA African Palliative Outcome Scale) in a multi-centred international study.Methods: Validation was conducted across 5 African services and in 3 phases: Phase 1. Face validity: content analysis of qualitative interviews and cognitive interviewing of POS; Phase 2. Construct validity: correlation of POS with Missoula-Vitas Quality of Life Index (Spearman's rank tests); Phase 3. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha calculated twice using 2 datasets), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients calculated for 2 time points) and time to complete (calculated twice using 2 datasets).Results: The validation involved 682 patients and 437 family carers, interviewed in 8 different languages. Phase 1. Qualitative interviews (N = 90 patients; N = 38 carers) showed POS items mapped well onto identified needs; cognitive interviews (N = 73 patients; N = 29 carers) demonstrated good interpretation; Phase 2. POS-MVQoLI Spearman's rank correlations were low-moderate as expected (N = 285); Phase 3. (N = 307, 2nd assessment mean 21.2 hours after first, SD 7.2) Cronbach's Alpha was 0.6 on both datasets, indicating expected moderate internal consistency; test-retest found high intra-class correlation coefficients for all items (0.78-0.89); median time to complete 7 mins, reducing to 5 mins at second visit.Conclusions: The APCA African POS has sound psychometric properties, is well comprehended and brief to use. Application of this tool offers the opportunity to at last address the omissions of palliative care research in Africa. {\textcopyright} 2010 Harding et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose: To describe how stakeholder engagement has been undertaken and evaluated in rehabilitation research. Methods: A scoping review of the scientific literature using five search strategies. Quantitative and qualitative analyses using extracted data. Interpretation of results was iteratively discussed within the team, which included a parent stakeholder. Results: Searches identified 101 candidate papers; 28 were read in full to assess eligibility and 19 were included in the review. People with disabilities and their families were more frequently involved compared to other stakeholders. Stakeholders were often involved in planning and evaluating service delivery. A key issue was identifying stakeholders; strategies used to support their involvement included creating committees, organizing meetings, clarifying roles and offering training. Communication, power sharing and resources influenced how stakeholders could be engaged in the research. Perceived outcomes of stakeholder engagement included the creation of partnerships, facilitating the research process and the application of the results, and empowering stakeholders. Stakeholder engagement outcomes were rarely formally evaluated. Conclusions: There is a great interest in rehabilitation to engage stakeholders in the research process. However, further evidence is needed to identify effective strategies for meaningful stakeholder engagement that leads to more useful research that positively impacts practice.},

This paper aims to define stakeholder engagement and present a conceptual model for involving stakeholders in CER. Materials & methods: The definitions and model were developed from a literature search, expert input and experience with the Center for Comparative Effectiveness Research in Cancer Genomics, a proof-of-concept platform for stakeholder involvement in priority setting and CER study design. Results: Definitions for stakeholder and stakeholder engagement reflect the target constituencies and their role in CER. The ‘analytic-deliberative' conceptual model for stakeholder engagement illustrates the inputs, methods and outputs relevant to CER. The model differentiates methods at each stage of the project; depicts the relationship between components; and identifies outcome measures for evaluation of the process. Conclusion: While the definitions and model require testing before being broadly adopted, they are an important foundational step and will be useful for investigators, funders and stakeholder groups interested in contributing to CER.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to create a “refined” (with unnecessary elements removed) definition of the term stakeholder, thereby removing confusion surrounding the use of this term from the general and project management arenas. Design/methodology/approach: A method of deriving refined definitions for a group of terms by ensuring there are no unnecessary elements causing internal conflict or overlap is adopted and applied to resolve the confusion. Findings: The refined definitions of stake and stakeholder are in terms of an interest and activity. This avoids all extensions of meaning introduced by defining particular types of stakeholders and/ or their degrees of impact. It also resolves the multiplicity of conflicting meanings possible when silent or assumed qualifiers of a word are ignored, restricting definition to, for example, project stakeholders or stakeholders of a firm. These definitions are carried forward into a mapping of the stakeholder locus of interest on an activity rather than a company base, enabling generic categorisation of stakeholders to be proposed for use in both private and public sectors. A governance difficulty with the term customer also emerged and a resolution to this is proposed. Research limitations/implications: Resolution of the academic contention around the definition of stakeholders will facilitate future research endeavours by removing confusion surrounding the term. It can also provide clarity in governance arrangements in public and private sectors. Verification of the method used through its success in deriving this “refined” definition suggests its suitability for application to other contested terms. Practical implications: Projects and businesses alike can benefit from removal of confusion around the definition of stakeholder in the academic research they fund and attempt to apply. Social implications: A refined definition of the stakeholder concept will facilitate building social and physical systems and infrastructure, benefitting organisations, whether public, charitable or private. Originality/value: Clarity results in the avoidance of confusion and misunderstanding together with their consequent waste of time, resources and money.},

abstract = {Background: Closing the gap between research production and research use is a key challenge for the health research system. Stakeholder engagement is being increasingly promoted across the board by health research funding organisations, and indeed by many researchers themselves, as an important pathway to achieving impact. This opinion piece draws on a study of stakeholder engagement in research and a systematic literature search conducted as part of the study. Main body: This paper provides a short conceptualisation of stakeholder engagement, followed by 'design principles' that we put forward based on a combination of existing literature and new empirical insights from our recently completed longitudinal study of stakeholder engagement. The design principles for stakeholder engagement are organised into three groups, namely organisational, values and practices. The organisational principles are to clarify the objectives of stakeholder engagement; embed stakeholder engagement in a framework or model of research use; identify the necessary resources for stakeholder engagement; put in place plans for organisational learning and rewarding of effective stakeholder engagement; and to recognise that some stakeholders have the potential to play a key role. The principles relating to values are to foster shared commitment to the values and objectives of stakeholder engagement in the project team; share understanding that stakeholder engagement is often about more than individuals; encourage individual stakeholders and their organisations to value engagement; recognise potential tension between productivity and inclusion; and to generate a shared commitment to sustained and continuous stakeholder engagement. Finally, in terms of practices, the principles suggest that it is important to plan stakeholder engagement activity as part of the research programme of work; build flexibility within the research process to accommodate engagement and the outcomes of engagement; consider how input from stakeholders can be gathered systematically to meet objectives; consider how input from stakeholders can be collated, analysed and used; and to recognise that identification and involvement of stakeholders is an iterative and ongoing process. Conclusion: It is anticipated that the principles will be useful in planning stakeholder engagement activity within research programmes and in monitoring and evaluating stakeholder engagement. A next step will be to address the remaining gap in the stakeholder engagement literature concerned with how we assess the impact of stakeholder engagement on research use.},

@article{Brunton2017,
abstract = {Background: Government policy increasingly supports engaging communities to promote health. It is critical to consider whether such strategies are effective, for whom, and under what circumstances. However, 'community engagement' is defined in diverse ways and employed for different reasons. Considering the theory and context we developed a conceptual framework which informs understanding about what makes an effective (or ineffective) community engagement intervention. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of community engagement in public health interventions using: stakeholder involvement; searching, screening, appraisal and coding of research literature; and iterative thematic syntheses and meta-analysis. A conceptual framework of community engagement was refined, following interactions between the framework and each review stage. Results: From 335 included reports, three products emerged: (1) two strong theoretical 'meta-narratives': one, concerning the theory and practice of empowerment/engagement as an independent objective; and a more utilitarian perspective optimally configuring health services to achieve defined outcomes. These informed (2) models that were operationalized in subsequent meta-analysis. Both refined (3) the final conceptual framework. This identified multiple dimensions by which community engagement interventions may differ. Diverse combinations of intervention purpose, theory and implementation were noted, including: ways of defining communities and health needs; initial motivations for community engagement; types of participation; conditions and actions necessary for engagement; and potential issues influencing impact. Some dimensions consistently co-occurred, leading to three overarching models of effective engagement which either: utilised peer-led delivery; employed varying degrees of collaboration between communities and health services; or built on empowerment philosophies. Conclusions: Our conceptual framework and models are useful tools for considering appropriate and effective approaches to community engagement. These should be tested and adapted to facilitate intervention design and evaluation. Using this framework may disentangle the relative effectiveness of different models of community engagement, promoting effective, sustainable and appropriate initiatives.},

abstract = {Background: The role of patient involvement in health research has evolved over the past decade. Despite efforts to engage patients as partners, the role is not well understood. We undertook this review to understand the engagement practices of patients who assume roles as partners in health research. Methods: Using a recognized methodological approach, two academic databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) and grey literature sources were searched. Findings were organized into one of the three higher levels of engagement, described by the Patient and Researcher Engagement framework developed by Manafo. We examined and quantified the supportive strategies used during involvement, used thematic analysis as described by Braun and Clarke and themed the purpose of engagement, and categorized the reported outcomes according to the CIHR Engagement Framework. Results: Out of 6621 records, 119 sources were included in the review. Thematic analysis of the purpose of engagement revealed five themes: documenting and advancing PPI, relevance of research, co-building, capacity building and impact on research. Improved research design was the most common reported outcome and the most common role for patient partners was as members of the research team, and the most commonly used strategy to support involvement was by meetings. Conclusion: The evidence collected during this review advanced our understanding of the engagement of patients as research partners. As patient involvement becomes more mainstream, this knowledge will aid researchers and policy-makers in the development of approaches and tools to support engagement. Patient/User Involvement: Patients led and conducted the grey literature search, including the synthesis and interpretation of the findings.},

Sample: Nineteen participants from faith-based organizations (FBOs) in Genesee County (74.5% Caucasian, 3.0% Hispanic American). Measurements: Semi-structured narrative focus group interviews, using thematic coding and qualitative analysis software (Otter.com). Results: Participants from diverse FBOs revealed barriers that prevent them from reaching their weight goals and preventing or controlling diabetes. A shared theme included the concern that providers do not actively inquire about patient concerns at appointments, and they fail to offer practical strategies beyond pharmaceutical interventions. Conclusion: Focus group interviews with community residents revealed issues and barriers patients and their support persons face in health care experiences. Utilizing CBPR (methodology) is an opportunity for advanced practice nurses (health care professionals) to co-create strategies and interventions with the community that can assist them in successfully reaching their weight loss and diabetes prevention goals.},

We describe a novel approach applied to obesity management and diabetes prevention. This takes advantage of a network of science clubs organized by the Health Sciences and Technology Academy (HSTA) for extracurricular activity of disadvantaged high school students in rural Appalachia. Physician scientists and educators provided an intensive summer course on CBPR, ethics, and study design on obesity management and diabetes prevention. Ethical certification for CBPR investigation was obtained for 210 students and 18 mentors for a study on the prevalence of obesity and Type II diabetes within their community. Over a 6-month period, 989 had a collection of complete analyzable data, of which 103 had diabetes. The proportion with obesity (BMI > or = 30) was over 50%. The frequency of diabetes was related to increasing BMI. When BMI > or = 40, the frequency approached 50%, and exhibited a clear familial distribution. We conclude that trained adolescents can effectively conduct CBPR, and obesity and diabetes are more prevalent than previously reported in this community. This experience provides encouragement to conduct future studies to infl uence weight management from high-risk populations in this medically disadvantaged community.},

abstract = {Obesity, together with related co-morbidities and psycho-social stigma, is highly prevalent amongst indigenous populations including the Māori people of New Zealand. This is of particular concern as indigenous peoples historically and currently experience health inequities. The primary objective of this work is to use the community-based participatory research (CBPR) paradigm to develop a methodological framework in an indigenous context, to enable an interpretation of health and wellness in relation to obesity. In this paper we present the process we used to develop our approach and our modified CBPR framework as a platform to explore perceptions of wellness to facilitate improved health outcomes. We embedded cultural values and beliefs held within a traditional Māori knowledge framework into CBPR, as a way to identify meaningful health promotion and prevention strategies in a New Zealand indigenous community. Our modified framework positioned indigenous people as decision-makers at the forefront of the research process from conception through to implementation and analysis. Acknowledging the research capacity of an indigenous community and facilitating their leadership research role was identified as being crucial in order to engage in a process aimed at investigating a priority public health issue. CBPR with an indigenous community identified three foundation elements of when conducting research: [1] relationship building, [2] consultation and generation of an identified research area of need, and [3] formation of an indigenous panel of expertise to provide leadership for all aspects of the research process.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the background, approach and general results of the Center for Alaska Native Health Research (CANHR) study. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) study with one tribal group to assess risk and protection for obesity and the risk factors related to chronic disease, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. METHODS: A combination of biological, genetic, nutritional and psychosocial measurements were taken on 922 Alaska Native participants in ten communities in Southwestern Alaska. The paper reports on data from 753 adult participants. RESULTS: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 3.3% in the sample population. Metabolic syndrome is significantly lower among the males and equal for females when compared with Caucasians in the NHANES III sample. Obesity among adults is now at the national average. Risk factors for chronic disease include a shift to a Westernized diet, stress, obesity and impaired fasting glucose and protective factors include high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid dietary intake. Articles in this issue present specific results in these areas. CONCLUSIONS: The data strongly indicate that, in general, Yup'ik people in our study are metabolically healthy and that diet and life style provide a delicate combination of protective and risk factors. The results strongly indicate that solution focused research utilizing primary and secondary prevention strategies may provide evidence for how to intervene to prevent further increases of chronic diseases. Research that focuses on relating the intrinsic strengths of indigenous worldviews and practices with basic research may contribute to positive transformations in community health.},

abstract = {Background: Pacific Island (PI) communities have the highest prevalence of obesity, globally; the Republic of Palau (Palau) in Micronesia reports as many as 46% of the population is overweight. Unfortunately, evidence-based obesity reduction programs in the Pacific are scarce to nonexistent. We developed a community-based participatory collaboration to address the best methods for delivering obesity interventions in Palau. Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews and administered questionnaires to 55 Palauan key informants, several of whom were part of our local Project Advisory Committee. Participants were queried about factors that contributed to overweight, the best methods for delivering interventions, and comfort with technology. Results: Most participants reported difficulty monitoring food intake during community celebrations (“customs”) and expressed concern that there were few affordable healthy food options available. Participants overwhelmingly favored weight-management programs that involved youth and families; taught them how to make healthier food choices, especially in social situations; and taught them how to increase physical activity. Participants wanted to learn techniques that led to small but sustainable changes, and most were interested in programs that utilized novel technology, e.g., mobile monitoring devices and interactive media. Conclusions: As we collaboratively develop weight-management curriculum in Palau, we are infusing evidence-based practices with the unique cultural, geographic, and economic concerns of this PI community. The new program, designed to support healthy living activities, will be administered by local providers and utilize technology to increase access, engagement, and adherence.},

One potential model for implementing and monitoring CBPR is Action Learning Collaboratives (ALCs); short term, team- based learning processes that are grounded in quality improvement. Since 2010, the Prevention Research Center at Dartmouth (PRCD) has used ALCs with three communities as a platform to design, implement and evaluate CBPR. The first ALC provided an opportunity for academia and community leadership to strengthen their relationships and knowledge of respective assets through design and evaluation of community- based QI projects. Building on this work, we jointly designed and are implementing a second ALC, a cross- community research project focused on obesity prevention in vulnerable populations. An enhanced community capacity now exists to support CBPR activities with a high degree of sophistication and decreased reliance on external facilitation. {\textcopyright} Meharry Medical College.},

Method: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) strategies were used including collaborative development of research question, study design and intervention. The latter was delivered as a team, including service agency staff, consumers and direct service providers (DSP). The study sample consisted of 11 consumers and 4 DSP. Monthly meetings stressed portion control, increased activity, label reading, and healthy nutrition choices. Portion-control dishes (9 inch diameter divided plates, 8 ounce glasses, and smaller snack/cereal bowls) were used in community residences. Results: Overall weight change was a 3-pound gain from baseline to programme completion at 7 months. Consumers and DSP described increased activity and healthier food choices. Conclusions: Weight loss was not an outcome; yet education and insight into healthier choices were observed. CPBR facilitates study, the finding of solutions to promote optimal health, and development of tailored interventions for significant health issues.},

@article{Coughlin2017,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The literature on community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches for promoting healthy diet and nutrition and preventing and controlling obesity in African-American communities was systematically reviewed as part of the planning process for new research. METHODS: CBPR studies of diet, nutrition, and weight management among African-Americans were identified from 1989 through October 31, 2015, using PubMed and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases and MeSH term and keyword searches. RESULTS: A total of 16 CBPR studies on healthy diet, nutrition, and weight management among African-Americans were identified; outcome evaluation results were available for all but two. Of the remaining 14 studies, 11 focused on adults, 1 on children, and 2 on both children and adults. Eight studies employed CBPR methods to address diet, nutrition, and weight management in church settings. Four had a cluster-randomized controlled design. Others had a pre-post test, quasi-experimental, or uncontrolled design. Only one study addressed four levels of the socioecological model; none addressed all five levels of the model. The studies identified in this review indicate that CBPR approaches can be effective for promoting healthy diet, nutrition, and weight management among African-American adults, but there is a need for additional studies with rigorous study designs that overcome methodologic limitations of many existing studies. There is only limited evidence for the effectiveness of CBPR approaches for promoting healthy eating and weight control among African-American children and adolescents. CONCLUSION: To address health disparities, additional CBPR studies are needed to promote healthy diet, nutrition, and weight management in African-American communities. Of particular interest are multilevel CBPR studies that include interventions aimed at multiple levels of the socioecological model.},

@article{Cruz2023,
abstract = {Background: In 2021/22, in England, 10.1% of children aged 4-5 years were living with obesity. Children living in the most deprived areas were more than twice as likely to be living with obesity, than those living in the least deprived areas. Breast-feeding can significantly reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents. Data from the 2010 Infant Feeding Survey showed that 46% of mothers in the most deprived areas were breastfeeding, compared with 65% in least deprived areas. As part of an Obesity Policy Research Unit project Investigating the origins of and risk factors that are known to create and widen inequalities in childhood obesity, we ran a public and patient involvement (PPI) meeting to investigate how to promote breast-feeding to contribute to reducing the inequalities in childhood obesity. The broader project aims to identify critical windows across the early life course for the development of inequalities that may be susceptible for intervention. Methods: In November 2022, the National Children's Bureau Family Research Advisory Group, a PPI group comprised of parents and carers from across the UK, participated and advised on the topic of breast-feeding and its promotion in an hour-long discussion. Results:Seven parents participated in this meeting. There were three main points regarding the promotion of breast-feeding as an intervention to decrease obesity in children. Firstly, some of the participants highlighted that it should be a woman's choice to breast-feed their child and there is a strong pressure to adopt it, because it is good for the child without considering the woman's willingness or ability to do it. Secondly, the lack of support to promote breast-feeding and help on how to do it in hospital or home visits were also mentioned as a reason to stop breast-feeding early or not do it. The parents also mentioned the need for more support in workplaces, especially if the mother works in shifts to allow for enough breaks to express breast milk. They agreed that ultimately it should be a woman's choice and support and advice should be available. Conclusions: Insights from this PPI meeting were useful to understand that the success of promotion of breast-feeding as an intervention to narrow the inequalities in childhood obesity should focus on multiple actors: the woman, child, health practitioners and wider community (e.g. employers).},

Community-based participatory research (CBPR) can be effective in translating public health policy into practice. We describe lessons learned from developing and pilot testing a middle school-based obesity prevention intervention using CBPR in Los Angeles, California. We formed a community-academic partnership between the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the UCLA/RAND Center for Adolescent Health Promotion to identify community needs and priorities for addressing adolescent obesity and to develop and pilot test a school-based intervention. Academic partners need to be well-versed in organizational structures and policies. Partnerships should be built on relationships of trust, shared vision, and mutual capacity building, with genuine community engagement at multiple levels. These lessons are critical, not only for partnering with schools on obesity prevention, but also for working in other community settings and on other health issues.},

@article{Berge2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: To date there has been limited success with childhood obesity prevention interventions. This may be due in part, to the challenge of reaching and engaging parents in interventions. The current study used a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to engage parents in cocreating and pilot testing a childhood obesity prevention intervention. Because CBPR approaches to childhood obesity prevention are new, this study aims to detail the creation, including the formation of the citizen action group (CAG), and implementation of a childhood obesity prevention intervention using CBPR methods.
METHOD: A CBPR approach was used to recruit community members to partner with university researchers in the CAG (n = 12) to create and implement the Play It Forward! childhood obesity intervention. The intervention creation and implementation took 2 years. During Year 1 (2011-2012), the CAG carried out a community needs and resources assessment and designed a community-based and family focused childhood obesity prevention intervention. During Year 2 (2012-2013), the CAG implemented the intervention and conducted an evaluation. Families (n = 50; 25 experimental/25 control group) with children ages 6-12 years participated in Play It Forward!
RESULTS: Feasibility and process evaluation data suggested that the intervention was highly feasible and participants in both the CAG and intervention were highly satisfied. Specifically, over half of the families attended 75% of the Play It Forward! events and 33% of families attended all the events.
CONCLUSION: Equal collaboration between parents and academic researchers to address childhood obesity may be a promising approach that merits further testing.},

@article{Johnson-Shelton2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is a systemic and complex, multilevel public health problem. Research approaches are needed that effectively engage communities in reversing environmental determinants of child obesity.
OBJECTIVES: This article discusses the Communities and Schools Together (CAST) Project and lessons learned about the project's community-based participatory research (CBPR) model.
METHODS: A partnership of schools, community organizations, and researchers used multiple methods to examine environmental health risks for childhood obesity and conduct school-community health programs. Action work groups structured partner involvement for designing and implementing study phases.
LESSONS LEARNED: CBPR in child obesity prevention involves engaging multiple communities with overlapping yet divergent goals. Schools are naturally situated to participate in child obesity projects, but engagement of key personnel is essential for functional partnerships. Complex societal problems require CBPR approaches that can align diverse communities and necessitate significant coordination by researchers. CBPR can provide simultaneous health promotion across multiple communities in childhood obesity prevention initiatives. Support for emergent partner activities is an essential practice for maintaining community interest and involvement in multiyear CBPR projects.
CONCLUSION: Investigator-initiated CBPR partnerships can effectively organize and facilitate large, health-promoting partnerships involving multiple, diverse stakeholder communities. Lessons learned from CAST illustrate the synergy that can propel projects that are holistically linked to the agents of a community.},

abstract = {Employing a participatory research design permits members of the target population to play an active role within intervention development and implementation. The aim of this study was to collaborate with members of the general population to design a physical activity (PA) intervention for sedentary overweight and obese males. Based on data collected from a cross-sectional lifestyle survey in Bath and North East Somerset (UK), males aged 25-55 years were recruited according to their self-reported PA level (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) and anthropometric assessment (body mass index, waist circumference). Consenting participants were classified into either the physically active and healthy body size group (PAH; n = 6), or the sedentary and overweight/obese group (SOW; n = 6). Semi-structured interviews were undertaken and Atlas.ti was used to explore the transcripts according to the tenets of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Males in the SOW group identified time, money, and motivation as perceived barriers preventing regular participation in PA. To overcome the perceived barriers of time, expense and accessibility, PAH participants suggested that walking may prove a useful vehicle to increase PA levels in SOW individuals and SOW participants also highlighted walking as a preferred activity. Study findings suggest that future PA interventions for SOW males may maximise participation and adherence rates by promoting activities that are affordable, appealing and can be easily incorporated into an individual's daily work-life schedule. Based on the study findings, a pilot randomised controlled trial was designed and implemented to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a six-week walking intervention (Walkabout to Workout Programme) on selected cardiovascular risk factors in SOW males.},

Embedded in these issues is an unwarranted acceptance of limited associations between certain assumptions, logics, forms of data, and methods of data collection/generation and analysis.

This plurality in TA is often not recognised by editors, reviewers or authors, who promote ‘coding reliability measures' as universal requirements of quality TA. Focusing particularly on our reflexive TA approach, we discuss quality in TA with reference to ten common problems we have identified in published TA research that cites or claims to follow our guidance. Many of the common problems are underpinned by an assumption of homogeneity in TA. We end by outlining guidelines for reviewers and editors–in the form of twenty critical questions–to support them in promoting high(er) standards in TA research, and more deliberative and reflexive engagement with TA as method and practice.},

abstract = {Background: The habitual "any other comments" general open question at the end of structured questionnaires has the potential to increase response rates, elaborate responses to closed questions, and allow respondents to identify new issues not captured in the closed questions. However, we believe that many researchers have collected such data and failed to analyse or present it. Discussion: General open questions at the end of structured questionnaires can present a problem because of their uncomfortable status of being strictly neither qualitative nor quantitative data, the consequent lack of clarity around how to analyse and report them, and the time and expertise needed to do so. We suggest that the value of these questions can be optimised if researchers start with a clear understanding of the type of data they wish to generate from such a question, and employ an appropriate strategy when designing the study. The intention can be to generate depth data or 'stories' from purposively defined groups of respondents for qualitative analysis, or to produce quantifiable data, representative of the population sampled, as a 'safety net' to identify issues which might complement the closed questions. Summary: We encourage researchers to consider developing a more strategic use of general open questions at the end of structured questionnaires. This may optimise the quality of the data and the analysis, reduce dilemmas regarding whether and how to analyse such data, and result in a more ethical approach to making best use of the data which respondents kindly provide. {\textcopyright} 2004 O'Cathain and Thomas; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Free-text comments are often invited at the end of self-completion questionnaires, yet text books provide no guidance on how these might be used. We describe a variety of ways in which free-text comments can be used, drawing on two examples. An Audit Commission study of NHS maternity care included a national sample survey of 3570 women who gave birth in June and July 1995. At the end of the questionnaire women were asked: Is there anything else you would like to tell us about your care while you were pregnant or since you have had your baby. The United Kingdom Medical Careers Research Group conducts whole-cohort longitudinal studies of graduates from all UK medical schools. At the end of each survey doctors are invited to write comments on "any aspect of your training, career choices or work". The authors discuss the inherent limitations of free-text comments, the relative merits of quantifying the frequencies of themes, and the ways in which free-text comments can be used to enhance survey analysis. They conclude that while free-text comments are no substitute for properly designed research, they are nevertheless valuable in understanding and illustrating participants' survey responses, and in suggesting topics for further research.},

abstract = {Background: Complex interventions are common in palliative and end-of-life care. Mixed methods approaches sit well within the multiphase model of complex intervention development and evaluation. Generic mixed methods guidance is useful but additional challenges in the research design and operationalization within palliative and end-of-life care may have an impact on the use of mixed methods. Objective: The objective of the study was to develop guidance on the best methods for combining quantitative and qualitative methods for health and social care intervention development and evaluation in palliative and end-of-life care. Methods: A one-day workshop was held where experts participated in facilitated groups using Transparent Expert Consultation to generate items for potential recommendations. Agreement and consensus were then sought on nine draft recommendations (DRs) in a follow-up exercise. Results: There was at least moderate agreement with most of the DRs, although consensus was low. Strongest agreement was with DR1 (usefulness of mixed methods to palliative and end-of-life care) and DR5 (importance of attention to respondent burden), and least agreement was with DR2 (use of theoretical perspectives) and DR6 (therapeutic effects of research interviews). Narrative comments enabled recommendation refinement. Two fully endorsed, five partially endorsed, and two refined DRs emerged. The relationship of these nine to six key challenges of palliative and end-of-life care research was analyzed. Conclusions: There is a need for further discussion of these recommendations and their contribution to methodology. The recommendations should be considered when designing and operationalizing mixed methods studies of complex interventions in palliative care, and because they may have wider relevance, should be considered for other applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: A compelling ethical rationale supports patient engagement in healthcare research. It is also assumed that patient engagement will lead to research findings that are more pertinent to patients' concerns and dilemmas. However; it is unclear how to best conduct this process. In this systematic review we aimed to answer 4 key questions: what are the best ways to identify patient representatives? How to engage them in designing and conducting research? What are the observed benefits of patient engagement? What are the harms and barriers of patient engagement?. Methods. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane, EBSCO, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Business Search Premier, Academic Search Premier and Google Scholar. Included studies were published in English, of any size or design that described engaging patients or their surrogates in research design. We conducted an environmental scan of the grey literature and consulted with experts and patients. Data were analyzed using a non-quantitative, meta-narrative approach. Results: We included 142 studies that described a spectrum of engagement. In general, engagement was feasible in most settings and most commonly done in the beginning of research (agenda setting and protocol development) and less commonly during the execution and translation of research. We found no comparative analytic studies to recommend a particular method. Patient engagement increased study enrollment rates and aided researchers in securing funding, designing study protocols and choosing relevant outcomes. The most commonly cited challenges were related to logistics (extra time and funding needed for engagement) and to an overarching worry of a tokenistic engagement. Conclusions: Patient engagement in healthcare research is likely feasible in many settings. However, this engagement comes at a cost and can become tokenistic. Research dedicated to identifying the best methods to achieve engagement is lacking and clearly needed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Domecq et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Patient and public engagement is growing, but evaluative efforts remain limited. Reviews looking at evaluation tools for patient engagement in individual decision making do exist, but no similar articles in research and health systems have been published. Objective: Systematically review and appraise evaluation tools for patient and public engagement in research and health system decision making. Methods: We searched literature published between January 1980 and February 2016. Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL and PsycINFO) were consulted, as well as grey literature obtained through Google, subject-matter experts, social media and engagement organization websites. Two independent reviewers appraised the evaluation tools based on 4 assessment criteria: scientific rigour, patient and public perspective, comprehensiveness and usability. Results: In total, 10 663 unique references were identified, 27 were included. Most of these tools were developed in the last decade and were designed to support improvement of engagement activities. Only 11% of tools were explicitly based on a literature review, and just 7% were tested for reliability. Patients and members of the public were involved in designing 56% of the tools, mainly in the piloting stage, and 18.5% of tools were designed to report evaluation results to patients and the public. Conclusion: A growing number of evaluation tools are available to support patient and public engagement in research and health system decision making. However, the scientific rigour with which such evaluation tools are developed could be improved, as well as the level of patient and public engagement in their design and reporting.},

abstract = {Objective To investigate the impact of patient and public involvement (PPI) on rates of enrolment and retention in clinical trials and explore how this varies with the context and nature of PPI. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Ten electronic databases, including Medline, INVOLVE Evidence Library, and clinical trial registries. Eligibility criteria Experimental and observational studies quantitatively evaluating the impact of a PPI intervention, compared with no intervention or non-PPI intervention(s), on participant enrolment and/or retention rates in a clinical trial or trials. PPI interventions could include additional non-PPI components inseparable from the PPI (for example, other stakeholder involvement). Data extraction and analysis Two independent reviewers extracted data on enrolment and retention rates, as well as on the context and characteristics of PPI intervention, and assessed risk of bias. Random effects meta-analyses were used to determine the average effect of PPI interventions on enrolment and retention in clinical trials: main analysis including randomised studies only, secondary analysis adding non-randomised studies, and several exploratory subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Results 26 studies were included in the review; 19 were eligible for enrolment meta-analysis and five for retention meta-analysis. Various PPI interventions were identified with different degrees of involvement, different numbers and types of people involved, and input at different stages of the trial process. On average, PPI interventions modestly but significantly increased the odds of participant enrolment in the main analysis (odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval and prediction interval 1.01 to 1.34). Non-PPI components of interventions may have contributed to this effect. In exploratory subgroup analyses, the involvement of people with lived experience of the condition under study was significantly associated with improved enrolment (odds ratio 3.14 v 1.07; P=0.02). The findings for retention were inconclusive owing to the paucity of eligible studies (odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 4.14), for main analysis). Conclusions These findings add weight to the case for PPI in clinical trials by indicating that it is likely to improve enrolment of participants, especially if it includes people with lived experience of the health condition under study. Further research is needed to assess which types of PPI work best in particular contexts, the cost effectiveness of PPI, the impact of PPI at earlier stages of trial design, and the impact of PPI interventions specifically targeting retention.

abstract = {Objectives: Public and patient involvement (PPI) is required at all stages of research by many funding bodies such as the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). Given the high priority of PPI within NIHR programmes and the associated costs, it is important that the process of involvement and impact of PPI on health services research is evaluated. We aimed to develop a tool to quantitatively evaluate the quality of PPI in research from a PPI participant's perspective in order to inform the researchers about absolute level of quality (cross-sectional aspect) and changes in quality over time (longitudinal aspect). Setting: A primary care patient safety translational research centre. Participants: The 12 members of the Research User Group (RUG) of Greater Manchester Primary Care Patient Safety Translational Research Centre. Interventions: By their own choice each RUG member supported a specific research theme. The level of involvement varied from commenting on documents through to designing their own research projects. Primary and secondary outcome measures planned: Measure absolute score and change in score over time in a nine-point Likert score within individuals. Compare Likert scores before undertaking PPI with scores after PPI activities. Evaluate the usefulness of a questionnaire based on a theoretical framework of personal and research factors. Results: The questionnaire had an acceptable to good level of internal consistency (Cronbach's $\alpha$ 0.74-0.81). The majority of the individuals met their initial expectations (11/12) and scored high across all factors. There was no significant change over time in the aggregate score over all factors and all individuals, but there were differences within individuals and factors. A ceiling effect limited the questionnaire's usefulness to measure increasing scores. Conclusions: The questionnaire has been useful in evaluating the early stages of a PPI group and may be generalisable to another setting.},

abstract = {Public involvement (PI) in research has been steadily advancing in recent years. It has therefore,
become increasingly important to evaluate PI in research to:
- improve the quality of PI, and hence the quality of research
- evidence the impact of PI and encourage stakeholders to commit to having PI in research
- justify funding and other resources for PI, especially in times of financial constraint
- inform members of the public of the difference that they have made
- facilitate planning for future projects, e.g. taking steps to avoid harm or limitations
It is possible to evaluate both the process and impact of PI to achieve these objectives. The
approaches to evaluating PI in research are wide-ranging, from simple to in-depth, depending on the
level of robustness required i.e. greater robustness requires a more in-depth approach.
This guidance document will present and discuss four approaches to evaluating PI. Figure 1 provides
brief descriptions of each approach to help you select the one that is most appropriate for your

abstract = {In the UK, researchers across the health professions are increasingly being encouraged by policymakers and research commissioners to ‘involve' service users in research. A recent review shows there is some evidence that involving patients, carers, relatives, social or community groups directly and actively as part of the research process can improve the conduct of research studies and the impact of the findings. Yet, little is known about how involvement is played out within research studies and there is a need for more critical and consistent assessment of what constitutes quality involvement. The overall purpose of this paper is to support learning about quality service user involvement in health care research. The aim is to provide service users and researchers with a structured and consistent way to reflect and report on their experiences. A range of philosophical and social theories of power and empowerment were reviewed and synthesized to create a model of quality involvement. The analysis encompassed both service user factors (what a person feels able to do, whether they feel their potential is being fulfilled and their sense of being valued) alongside research factors (research relationships, ways of doing research, research structures). A model is presented (Quality Involvement Framework), which contributes theoretically informed perspectives about the meaning and assessment of quality service user involvement in research. The model is developed as a practical measure (a Quality Involvement Questionnaire) for researchers and service users to be more reflective about the constraints and possibilities of involvement. The tools presented here could help research teams to examine personal factors and the research contexts that influence the nature and quality of service user involvement in research. They may also help to identify reoccurring issues about quality which could inform future policy, practice and research. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has been shown to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. Whether semaglutide can reduce cardiovascular risk associated with overweight and obesity in the absence of diabetes is unknown. METHODS In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, event-driven superiority trial, we enrolled patients 45 years of age or older who had preexisting cardiovascular disease and a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 27 or greater but no history of diabetes. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg or placebo. The primary cardiovascular end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke in a time-to-first-event analysis. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS A total of 17,604 patients were enrolled; 8803 were assigned to receive semaglutide and 8801 to receive placebo. The mean (±SD) duration of exposure to semaglutide or placebo was 34.2±13.7 months, and the mean duration of follow-up was 39.8±9.4 months. A primary cardiovascular end-point event occurred in 569 of the 8803 patients (6.5%) in the semaglutide group and in 701 of the 8801 patients (8.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.90; P<0.001). Adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of the trial product occurred in 1461 patients (16.6%) in the semaglutide group and 718 patients (8.2%) in the placebo group (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS In patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and overweight or obesity but without diabetes, weekly subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke at a mean follow-up of 39.8 months.

abstract = {Background: Despite being a core business of medicine, end of life care (EoLC) is neglected. It is hampered by research that is difficult to conduct with no common standards. We aimed to develop evidence-based guidance on the best methods for the design and conduct of research on EoLC to further knowledge in the field.Methods: The Methods Of Researching End of life Care (MORECare) project built on the Medical Research Council guidance on the development and evaluation of complex circumstances. We conducted systematic literature reviews, transparent expert consultations (TEC) involving consensus methods of nominal group and online voting, and stakeholder workshops to identify challenges and best practice in EoLC research, including: participation recruitment, ethics, attrition, integration of mixed methods, complex outcomes and economic evaluation. We synthesised all findings to develop a guidance statement on the best methods to research EoLC.Results: We integrated data from three systematic reviews and five TECs with 133 online responses. We recommend research designs extending beyond randomised trials and encompassing mixed methods. Patients and families value participation in research, and consumer or patient collaboration in developing studies can resolve some ethical concerns. It is ethically desirable to offer patients and families the opportunity to participate in research. Outcome measures should be short, responsive to change and ideally used for both clinical practice and research. Attrition should be anticipated in studies and may affirm inclusion of the relevant population, but careful reporting is necessitated using a new classification. Eventual implementation requires consideration at all stages of the project.Conclusions: The MORECare statement provides 36 best practice solutions for research evaluating services and treatments in EoLC to improve study quality and set the standard for future research. The statement may be used alongside existing statements and provides a first step in setting common, much needed standards for evaluative research in EoLC.

abstract = {Background: Patient-centred measures to capture symptoms and concerns have rarely been reported in severe COVID. We adapted and tested the measurement properties of the proxy version of the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale–IPOS-COV for severe COVID using psychometric approach. Methods: We consulted experts and followed consensus-based standards for the selection of health status measurement instruments and United States Food and Drug Administration guidance for adaptation and analysis. Exploratory Factor Analysis and clinical perspective informed subscales. We tested the internal consistency reliability, calculated item total correlations, examined re-test reliability in stable patients, and also evaluated inter-rater reproducibility. We examined convergent and divergent validity of IPOS-COV with the Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Scale and evaluated known-groups validity. Ability to detect change was examined. Results: In the adaptation phase, 6 new items were added, 7 items were removed from the original measure. The recall period was revised to be the last 12–24 h to capture fast deterioration in COVID. General format and response options of the original Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale were preserved. Data from 572 patients with COVID from across England and Wales seen by palliative care services were included. Four subscales were supported by the 4-factor solution explaining 53.5% of total variance. Breathlessness-Agitation and Gastro-intestinal subscales demonstrated good reliability with high to moderate (a = 0.70 and a = 0.67) internal consistency, and item–total correlations (0.62–0.21). All except the Flu subscale discriminated well between patients with differing disease severity. Inter-rater reliability was fair with ICC of 0.40 (0.3–0.5, 95% CI, n = 324). Correlations between the subscales and AKPS as predicted were weak (r = 0.13–0.26) but significant (p < 0.01). Breathlessness-Agitation and Drowsiness-Delirium subscales demonstrated good divergent validity. Patients with low oxygen saturation had higher mean Breathlessness-Agitation scores (M = 5.3) than those with normal levels (M = 3.4), t = 6.4 (186), p < 0.001. Change in Drowsiness-Delirium subscale correctly classified patients who died. Conclusions: IPOS-COV is the first patient-centred measure adapted for severe COVID to support timely management. Future studies could further evaluate its responsiveness and clinical utility with clinimetric approaches.},

abstract = {The concept of community participation continues to capture the attention of international health policy-makers and analysts nearly a quarter of a century after it was formally introduced at the Alma Ata Conference. This paper reviews trends in the participation literature of the 1990s, drawing examples primarily from Latin America. The following topics are discussed: sustainability, new methods for operationalizing and evaluating participation, the significance of local and cultural variability in determining outcomes, participatory self-determination as raised in the social movements literature, the increasing importance of intersectoral linkages, and continuing impediments posed by biomedical ideologies and systems. While the rhetoric and practice of participation have become fully integrated into mainstream health and development discourses, the paper concludes that ideological and political disagreements continue to divide pragmatists, who favour utilitarian models of participation, from activists, who prefer empowerment models.},

abstract = {Although there are numerous methods for setting priorities across health services, no equivalent attention has been given to ways of setting priorities for health services research. One of the greatest lessons from setting these priorities is that the involvement of users, while difficult to achieve, is central to clarifying the underlying values and assumptions often buried in technical, data-driven exercises. It also leads the users to greater ownership in and commitment to the eventual priorities. This article applies these lessons to setting priorities for applied health services research, outlined in a six-stage "listening model." The model is then applied to both an English and a Canadian case study, and the lessons from these experiences are summarized.},

abstract = {Background: Over the last 10 years, patient engagement in health research has emerged as the next evolution in healthcare research. However, limited evidence about the clear role and scope of patient engagement in health research and a lack of evidence about its impact have influenced the uptake, implementation and ongoing evolution of patient engagement. The present study aims to conduct a scoping review to identify methods for and outcomes of patient engagement in health research. Methods: An adaptation of the scoping review methodology originally described by Arksey and O'Malley and updated by Levac, Colquhoun and O'Brien was applied. Sources from a formal database search and relevant documents from a grey literature search were compiled into data extraction tables. Articles were synthesised into key themes according to the (1) methods and (2) outcomes of patient engagement in health research. Results: The total yield for the scoping review was 55 records from across Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. While evidence about the methods used to engage patients in health research is increasing, stronger evidence of specific patient and healthcare system outcomes is required. This necessitates further mobilisation of research that explores outcomes and that validates specific tools to evaluate engagement. Additionally, theoretical frameworks that can better inform and sustain patient engagement across the lifecycle of health research are lacking. Conclusion: Further increasing the volume and reach of evidence about patient engagement in health research will support the paradigmatic shift needed to normalise the patient's role in research beyond 'subject' or 'participant', so as to ultimately improve patient health outcomes and better address healthcare reform in Canada.},

In the current study we aim to target TNBC through eco-friendly green synthesized silver nanoparticles having anti-cancer phytoconstituents from the traditional anti-cancer medicinal plant Eclipta alba. Green synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are agglomerates of spherical shaped 40-60 nm sized showing characteristic light absorption at 437 nm, banding pattern at 1479, 1285, 1036, and 471 showing and further X-ray diffraction pattern confirm face-centered cubic crystal silver structure exist in the green synthesized silver nanoparticle preparation. Further in vitro anti-oxidant analysis results revealed that green synthesized AgNPs showed 2.6-fold higher anti-oxidant potential (IC50 15.70 g/ml) than that of aqueous plant leaf extract (IC50 39.80 g/ml). In MTT cytotoxicity analysis Eclipta alba plant extract and AgNPs both display dose-dependent cytotoxicity against triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), although their IC 50 values differ substantially, at 105.80 µg/ml and 77.20 g/ml, respectively. Finally, AgNPs from Eclipta alba tested for anti-leishmanial activity and it showed 91.36 ± 1.05 for promastigotes and 76.62 ± 0.95 for amastigotes at the highest dose of 400 g/ml. Altogether present data showed that Eclipta alba leaf extract actively bonded with silver nanoparticles suppresses the MDA-MB-231 cells growth through high antioxidant characters and anti-leishmanial activity. From together we confirm that Eclipta alba was recommended to a future therapeutic drug and agent to control breast cancer in the clinical level.},

abstract = {Introduction: The potential influence of a Mediterranean diet (MD), on PhA values has been little researched. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between adherence of a MD and PhA on adult sample population with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 331 patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Anthropometrics' data (weight, height, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference), BIA parameters (resistance reactance, PhA, fat mass (FM), fat free mass (FFM), skeletal muscle mass (SMM)), and biochemical parameters were recorded. Dietary intakes with a 3 days written food records and MD adherence with a validated 14-item questionnaire were evaluated. Patients were divided in two groups by median value of PhA. Results: Percentage of patients with high Mediterranean diet adherence (score>7) in high PhA group was 77.2% and in low PhA group was 41.4% (Odds ratio 1.91, 95% CI=1.27-3.54; p=0.01). Total fat intake (saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats), protein intake and cholesterol intake were higher in High PhA group than Low PhA group. Total score of Mediterranean diet was higher in High PhA than Low PhA group (3.5+1.1 points; p=0.04). Fat free mass (3.3+0.9 kg;p=0.01), fat free mass index (3.9+1.1 kg/m2;p=0.01), skeletal muscle mass (4.6+1.2 kg;p=0.01) and skeletal muscle mass index (3.3+0.7 kg/m2;p=0.03) were higher in subjects of High adherence of MD group than subjects of Low adherence. Fat mass (-3.2+1.1 kg;p=0.03) was lower in subjects with good adherence to Mediterranean Diet. MD score (Beta 1.71, CI95% 1.06-2.16), (FFM) (Beta 3.99, CI95% 1.87-7.16) and (SMM) (Beta 4.21, CI95% 1.76-8.19) remained in the multivariate model. Conclusion: We concluded that a high adherence to a MD in subjects with obesity and metabolic syndrome is associated with values of PhA.},

abstract = {The primary objective of this study was to elucidate the chemical composition, antioxidant properties, and antiproliferative activities of Eclipta prostrata extracts. Two flavonoids, 3′-O-methylorobol and apigenin 7-sulfate, were isolated from the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of E. prostrata. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the E. prostrata extracts, as well as their overall antioxidant activities as measured using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and reducing power assays, were investigated. The E. prostrata EtOAc extract exhibited significantly greater antioxidant activities in both assays and higher phenol and flavonoid contents than the other extracts. The potential antiproliferative properties of the E. prostrata extracts and isolated compounds were investigated in vitro against the AGS, A549, and HT-29 cancer cell lines and the normal human HEK-293 cell line using the MTT assay. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining analysis and quantitative real-time PCR were used to assess AGS cell apoptosis. At a concentration of 100 µg/mL, the EtOAc extract of E. prostrata reduced AGS cell viability and proliferation by inducing apoptosis through the alteration of gene expression in the apoptotic cascade. These results highlight E. prostrata as a promising source of anticancer compounds.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Obesity is a common metabolic dysfunction disease, which is highly correlated with the homeostasis of gut microbiota (GM). The dysregulation of GM on energy metabolism, immune response, insulin resistance and endogenous metabolites (e.g., short chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids) can affect the occurrence and development of obesity. Herbal medicine (HM) has particular advantages and definite therapeutic effects in the prevention and treatment of obesity, but its underlying mechanism is not fully clear. Aim of the study: In this review, the representative basic and clinical anti-obesity studies associated with the homeostasis of GM regulated by HM including active components, single herb and herbal formulae were summarized and discussed. We aim to provide a state of art reference for the mechanism research of HM in treating obesity and the further development of new anti-obesity drugs. Materials and methods: The relevant information was collected by searching keywords (obesity, herbal medicine, prescriptions, mechanism, GM, short chain fatty acids, etc.) from scientiﬁc databases (CNKI, PubMed, SpringerLink, Web of Science, SciFinder, etc.). Results: GM dysbiosis did occur in obese patients and mice, whiles the intervention of GM could ameliorate the condition of obesity. HM (e.g., berberine, Ephedra sinica, Rehjnannia glutinosa, and Buzhong Yiqi prescription) has been proved to possess a certain regulation on GM and an explicit effect on obesity, but the exact mechanism of HM in improving obesity by regulating GM remains superficial. Conclusion: GM is involved in HM against obesity, and GM can be a novel therapeutic target for treating obesity.},

Lifestyle modification (dietary and exercise) is first-line evidence based treatment however there are barriers to success for this form of self-care and women often seek adjunct therapies including herbal medicines. This pragmatic, randomized controlled trial (RCT), delivered in communities of Australia in overweight women with PCOS, compared the effectiveness and safety of naturopathic herbal medicine plus lifestyle intervention against lifestyle alone. 122 overweight women with PCOS participated in this RCT. The herbal medicine consisted of two tablets; tablet one contained Cinnamomum verum, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hypericum perforatum and Paeonia lactiflora and tablet two contained Tribulus terrestris. The primary outcome was oligo/amenorrhea. Secondary outcomes were hormones, anthropometry, quality of life (QoL), depression, anxiety and stress (DAS), pregnancy, birth outcomes, and safety. At three months, women in the herbal medicine plus lifestyle group recorded a reduction in oligomenorrhoea of 32.9% (95% CI, 23.3-42.6,p<0.01) compared to controls, estimated as a large treatment effect size ($\eta$p2=0.11). Other significant improvements were found for body mass index (p<0.01), insulin (p=0.02) and luteinizing hormone (p=0.04), blood pressure (p=0.01), QoL(p<0.01), DAS(p<0.01) and pregnancy rates(p=0.01). This trial provides evidence of improved effectiveness for lifestyle intervention when combined with herbal medicines in women with PCOS.},

abstract = {Evidence Based Medicine seeks to use the best available evidence in making clinical decisions. Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analysis offer best evidence in the hierarchy of evidence. In this context, we conducted systematic reviews of RCTs and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of herbal medicine and mahuang in the treatment of obesity. Firstly, we searched Embase, Pubmed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for RCTs of herbal medicine in treatment of obesity up to June 2017. The search strategy followed the PRISMA and 11 intervention arms were analyzed. The methodological quality and publication bias were assessed using the risk of bias tool and funnel plot. Statistical pooling of data based on the random-effects models. We found the overall effect of herbal medicine was higher (Hedges' g =.155) than that of placebo and the effect of Ephedra was the highest (Hedges' g =.262) in subgroup analysis. In terms of adverse events (AEs), herbal medicine improved AST, ALT, and BUN level, indicating herbal medicine for obesity may not have toxic effect on the liver and kidney. Secondly, we searched NLM Medline, Cochrane library, Scopus, Science Direct, Research Information Sharing Service, and Korean Studies Information Service System for RCTs investigating the efficacy and safety of mahuang and ephedrine on the treatment of obesity from 2000 to 2017. We identified 172 studies and finally analyzed 16 RCTs. Mahuang and ephedrine significantly reduced body weight and fat mass with no serious AEs in all studies. The common complaints were insomnia, anxiety, nervousness, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, and dizziness. In particular, reported symptoms are mostly sympathetic/digestive-related and can be predicted and managed, suggesting appropriate dose of mahuang for healthy adult was safe. These findings provide evidence that herbal medicine and mahuang is effective and safe in the treatment of obesity.},

In this controlled trial, we evaluated the safety and effectiveness of Xin-Ju-Xiao-Gao-Fang (XJXGF), a TCM herbal formulation, in 140 obese subjects over a 24-week period. The XJXGF formula mainly consists of rhubarb, coptis, semen cassia, and citrus aurantium. Subjects with body mass index (BMI) 28-40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were recruited at 5 centers in China. We assessed the changes in subjects' body weight, its related parameters, and the reduction of insulin resistance (IR) after administration of XJXGF formula or low-dose XJXGF (10% of the XJXGF formula, as control). After 24-week treatment, among participants in the XJXGF formula group and low-dose XJXGF group, the mean ± SE changes in the body weight were -3.58 ± 0.48 and -1.91 ± 0.38 kg, respectively (p < 0.01). The changes in the IR-index of two groups were -2.65 ± 1.04 and -1.58 ± 1.3, respectively (p < 0.05). There were no serious adverse events reported during the 24-week trial. Participants reported 7 minor adverse events, 4 in the XJXGF formula group and 3 in the low-dose XJXGF group (p = 0.578). Future studies are needed to investigate the clinical utility of this TCM formulation in the treatment of obese subjects.},

abstract = {Background: Herbal medicine based on pattern identification (PI) is used widely in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Proper herbal medicine based on PI has been suggested for effective weight reduction and decreasing the adverse events. This systematic review examined the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicine, focusing on PI in treating obesity. Methods: Eight electric databases were used for searching randomized controlled trials (RCT) (to August 31, 2021). RCTs which prescribed herbal medicine to obese patients based on PI were included. Body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI) were the primary outcomes. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the meta-analysis was conducted. Grading the evidence was conducted by using GRADEpro. Results: Sixteen RCTs (1052 patients) were included: 2 studies compared herbal medicine to placebo (128 patients); 2 studies compared them to western medication (161 patients); 12 studies compared them with usual care (763 patients). The meta-analysis showed that the herbal formulas reduced the BW and BMI without significant Adverse events compared to the control group (BW: mean difference = -4.10, 95% confidence interval: -5.14 to -3.06, I2 = 2% and BMI: mean difference = -1.53, 95% confidence interval: -1.88 to -1.19, I2 = 25%). Moderate-quality evidence on the primary outcomes was found. Conclusions: Herbal medicine - has good clinical efficacy and safety in treating obesity. This study has limitations that some literatures with high risk of bias in blinding or without using a standardized diagnosis of PI were included. However, the current evidence suggests the possibility of precision medicine using PI.},

abstract = {Controlled trials that use randomized allocation are the best tool to control for bias and confounding in trials testing clinical interventions. Investigators must be sure to include information that is required by the reader to judge the validity and implications of the findings in the reports of these trials. In part, complete reporting of trials will allow clinicians to modify their clinical practice to reflect current evidence toward the improvement of clinical outcomes. The consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) statement was developed to assist investigators, authors, reviewers, and editors on the necessary information to be included in reports of controlled clinical trials. The CONSORT statement is applicable to any intervention, including herbal medicinal products. Controlled trials of herbal interventions do not adequately report the information suggested in CONSORT. Recently, reporting recommendations were developed in which several CONSORT items were elaborated to become relevant and complete for randomized controlled trials of herbal medicines. We expect that these recommendations will lead to more complete and accurate reporting of herbal trials. We wrote this explanatory document to outline the rationale for each recommendation and to assist authors in using them by providing the CONSORT items and the associated elaboration, together with examples of good reporting and empirical evidence, where available, for each. These recommendations for the reporting of herbal medicinal products presented here are open to revision as more evidence accumulates and critical comments are collected. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Although partial checklists are available, no consolidated reporting framework exists for any type of qualitative design. Objective: To develop a checklist for explicit and comprehensive reporting of qualitative studies (indepth interviews and focus groups). Methods: We performed a comprehensive search in Cochrane and Campbell Protocols, Medline, CINAHL, systematic reviews of qualitative studies, author or reviewer guidelines of major medical journals and reference lists of relevant publications for existing checklists used to assess qualitative studies. Seventy-six items from 22 checklists were compiled into a comprehensive list. All items were grouped into three domains: (i) research team and reflexivity, (ii) study design and (iii) data analysis and reporting. Duplicate items and those that were ambiguous, too broadly defined and impractical to assess were removed. Results: Items most frequently included in the checklists related to sampling method, setting for data collection, method of data collection, respondent validation of findings, method of recording data, description of the derivation of themes and inclusion of supporting quotations. We grouped all items into three domains: (i) research team and reflexivity, (ii) study design and (iii) data analysis and reporting. Conclusions: The criteria included in COREQ, a 32-item checklist, can help researchers to report important aspects of the research team, study methods, context of the study, findings, analysis and interpretations. {\textcopyright} The Author 2007.

abstract = {Background: There are mounting calls for robust, critical evaluation of the impact of patient and public involvement (PPI) in health research. However, questions remain about how to assess its impact, and whether it should be assessed at all. The debate has thus far been dominated by professionals. Objective: To explore the views of PPI contributors involved in health research regarding the impact of PPI on research, whether and how it should be assessed. Design: Qualitative interview study. Setting and participants: Thirty-eight PPI contributors involved in health research across the UK. Results: Participants felt that PPI has a beneficial impact on health research. They described various impactful roles, which we conceptualize as the ‘expert in lived experience', the ‘creative outsider', the ‘free challenger', the ‘bridger', the ‘motivator' and the ‘passive presence'. Participants generally supported assessing the impact of PPI, while acknowledging the challenges and concerns about the appropriateness and feasibility of measurement. They expressed a range of views about what impacts should be assessed, by whom and how. Individual feedback on impact was seen as an important driver of improved impact and motivation to stay involved. Conclusions: While there appears to be widespread support for PPI impact assessment among PPI contributors, their views on what to assess and how are diverse. PPI contributors should be involved as equal partners in debates and decisions about these issues. Individual feedback on impact may increase PPI contributors' potential impact and their motivation to stay involved.},

abstract = {Background: Policy-makers and health research funders increasingly require researchers to demonstrate that they have involved patients in the design and conduct of research. However, the extent to which patients and public have the power to get involved on an equal footing is dependent on their economic, cultural, social and symbolic capital. Objective: To explore power relations in patient and public involvement (PPI) in research, particularly how patients may wield symbolic capital to develop a more equal relationship. Methods: Narrative interviews with a maximum variation sample of 38 people involved as patients, carers or public in health research, analysed thematically. Findings: Symbolic capital may be demonstrated in a range of ways (sometimes alongside or in the absence of other forms of capital): illness experience, technical illness knowledge and the challenging outsider. Symbolic capital is unstable and dependent on others for recognition and legitimacy. Nonetheless, participants identify a gradual shift in power relations over time. Discussion and conclusions: Research into PPI has been conceptually and theoretically poor, limiting our understanding of its mechanisms and wider contextual elements. Our findings demonstrate the importance of reflecting on the forms of power and capital wielded by the health research community, and of acknowledging the way in which PPI is challenging the status quo. As one of the first papers to conceptualize how different forms of symbolic capital operate and their critical role in challenging the balance of power, our findings may help researchers better plan their PPI activities and reflect on their own power.},

abstract = {Objective: Patient and public involvement (PPI) in research has expanded nationally and internationally over the last decade, and recently there has been significant attention given to understanding its impact on research. Less attention has been given to the impact of PPI on the people involved, yet it has been shown that the success of PPI in research can be reliant on the processes of engagement between these individuals and communities. This paper therefore critically explores the impact of PPI on service users, researchers and communities involved in health and social care research.
Data Sources: Searches were undertaken from 1995 to April 2012 in the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, CINAHL, HMIC and HELMIS. Searches were undertaken for grey literature using the databases InvoNet and NHS Evidence.
Study Selection: Studies were included if they included the impact of PPI on individual service users, researchers or communities under research. Studies were excluded if they were in a foreign language (unless they were deemed critical to the systematic review) or were in children and adolescent services.
Study Appraisal: Data were extracted using a narrative synthesis, and quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme.
Conclusion: This is the first international systematic review to focus on the impact of PPI on the people involved in the process. The beneficial and challenging impacts reported highlight the importance of optimising the context and processes of involvement, so creating the potential for PPI to impact positively on the research itself.
Main Results: Service users reported feeling empowered and valued, gaining confidence and life skills. Researchers developed a greater understanding and insight into their research area, gaining respect and a good rapport with the community. The community involved in research became more aware and knowledgeable about their condition. However, lack of preparation and training led some service users to feel unable to contribute to the research, while other service users and communities reported feeling overburdened with the work involved. Researchers reported difficulties in incorporating PPI in meaningful ways due to lack of money and time.},

Setting and participants: Participants were drawn from health, social care, universities and consumer organizations. A purposive sampling strategy was used to identify people who had experience and/or knowledge of consumer involvement in NHS research. Six researchers and seven consumers participated in an expert workshop. Ninety-six people completed both rounds of the Delphi process. Main outcome measures: Consensus on principles and indicators of successful consumer involvement in NHS research. Results: Eight principles were developed through an expert workshop and Delphi process, and rated as both clear and valid. Consensus was reached on at least one clear and valid indicator by which to measure each principle. Conclusions: Consensus has been obtained on eight principles of successful consumer involvement in NHS research. They may help commissioners, researchers and consumers to deepen their understanding of this issue, and can be used to guide good practice.},

abstract = {Chronic breathlessness is highly distressing for people with advanced disease and their informal carers, yet health services for this group remain highly heterogeneous. We aimed to generate evidence-based stakeholder-endorsed recommendations for practice, policy and research concerning services for people with advanced disease and chronic breathlessness. We used transparent expert consultation, comprising modified nominal group technique during a stakeholder workshop, and an online consensus survey. Stakeholders, representing multiple specialities and professions, and patient/carers were invited to participate. Thirty-seven participants attended the stakeholder workshop and generated 34 separate recommendations, rated by 74 online survey respondents. Seven recommendations had strong agreement and high levels of consensus. Stakeholders agreed services should be person-centred and flexible, should cut across multiple disciplines and providers and should prioritize breathlessness management in its own right. They advocated for wide geographical coverage and access to expert care, supported through skills-sharing among professionals. They also recommended recognition of informal carers and their role by clinicians and policymakers. Overall, stakeholders' recommendations reflect the need for improved access to person-centred, multi-professional care and support for carers to provide or access breathlessness management interventions. Future research should test the optimal models of care and educational strategies to meet these recommendations.},

abstract = {Background: Support and evidence for patient, unpaid caregiver and public involvement in research (user involvement) are growing. Consensus on how best to involve users in palliative care research is lacking. Aim: To determine an optimal user-involvement model for palliative care research. Design: We hosted a consultation workshop using expert presentations, discussion and nominal group technique to generate recommendations and consensus on agreement of importance. A total of 35 users and 32 researchers were approached to attend the workshop, which included break-out groups and a ranking exercise. Descriptive statistical analysis to establish consensus and highlight divergence was applied. Qualitative analysis of discussions was completed to aid interpretation of findings. Setting/participants: Participants involved in palliative care research were invited to a global research institute, UK. Results: A total of 12 users and 5 researchers participated. Users wanted their involvement to be more visible, including during dissemination, with a greater emphasis on the difference their involvement makes. Researchers wanted to improve productivity, relevance and quality through involvement. Users and researchers agreed that an optimal model should consist of (a) early involvement to ensure meaningful involvement and impact and (b) diverse virtual and face-to-face involvement methods to ensure flexibility. Conclusion: For involvement in palliative care research to succeed, early and flexible involvement is required. Researchers should advertise opportunities for involvement and promote impact of involvement via dissemination plans. Users should prioritise adding value to research through enhancing productivity, quality and relevance. More research is needed not only to inform implementation and ensure effectiveness but also to investigate the cost-effectiveness of involvement in palliative care research.},

abstract = {Engagement activities are defined along a continuum that analyzes and represents nonacademic stakeholder activities and interactions with academic researchers. Proposed continua begin with none to limited stakeholder inclusion and input into research and continue with descriptions of increasing presence, input, and participation in decision-making. Despite some agreement in the literature, development of consistent terminology and definitions has been recommended to promote the common understanding of strategies in engaged research. This paper sought to develop and understand classifications and definitions of community-engaged research that can serve as the foundation of a measure of engaged research that permits comparisons among engagement strategies and the outcomes that they produce in health-and healthcare-related research studies. Data on academic and stakeholder perceptions and understandings of classifications and definitions were obtained using Delphi process (N = 19) via online and face-to-face survey and cognitive response interviews (N = 16). Participants suggested the need for more nuanced understanding of engagement along portions of the continuum, with active involvement and decision-making as engagement progressed. Cognitive interview responses suggested that outreach and education is a more advanced level of engagement than previously discussed in the literature and viewed consultation negatively because it required work without guaranteeing community benefit. It is possible to define a continuum of patient-and community-engaged research that is understood and accepted by both academic researchers and community members. However, future research should revisit the understanding and depiction of the strategies that are to be used in measure development.},

We searched the MEDLINE database and included qualitative studies of CBPR researchers or REC members about their experiences with RECs. The search yielded 107 studies, of which 10 met our criteria. Barriers were that the community is not prepared to conduct research, the reluctance of RECs to work outside the university, the difficulty RECs have understanding CBPR, and that REC forms evaluate individual rather than community risk. Facilitators were having a CBPR expert as an REC member and educating RECs. Therefore, RECs are not prepared to evaluate CBPR projects leading to unnecessary delays in the approval process.},

abstract = {Background: Independent charitably funded hospices have been an important element of the UK healthcare response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospices usually have different funding streams, procurement processes, and governance arrangements compared to NHS provision, which may affect their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to understand the challenges faced by charitably funded hospices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Eligible Organisations providing specialist palliative or hospice care completed the online CovPall survey (2020) which explored their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligible organisations were then purposively selected to participate in interviews as part of qualitative case studies (2020-21) to understand challenges in more depth. Free-text responses from the survey were analysed using content analysis and were categorised accordingly. These categorisations were used a priori for a reflexive thematic analysis of interview data. Results: 143 UK independent charitably funded hospices completed the online CovPall survey. Five hospices subsequently participated in qualitative case studies (n = 24 staff interviews). Key themes include: vulnerabilities of funding; infection control during patient care; and bereavement support provision. Interviewees discussed the fragility of income due to fundraising events stopping; the difficulties of providing care to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients within relatively small organisations; and challenges with maintaining the quality of bereavement services. Conclusion: Some unique care and provision challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted by charitably funded hospices. Funding core services charitably and independently may affect their ability to respond to pandemics, or scenarios where resources are unexpectedly insufficient.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To develop insights into response of palliative care services caring for people from ethnic minority groups during COVID-19. METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of UK palliative care services response to COVID-19. Quantitative data were summarised descriptively and $\chi$2 tests used to explore relationships between categorical variables. Free text comments were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: 277 UK services responded. 168 included hospice teams (76% of all UK hospice teams). Services supporting those from ethnic minority groups were more likely to include hospital (p<0.001) and less likely to include hospice (p<0.001) or home care teams (p=0.008). 34% (93/277) of services had cared for patients with COVID-19 or families from ethnic minority groups. 66% (61/93) of these services stated no difference in how they supported or reached these groups during the pandemic.Three themes demonstrated impact of policy introduced during the pandemic, including: disproportionate adverse impact of restricted visiting, compounded communication challenges and unmet religious and faith needs. One theme demonstrated mistrust of services by ethnic minority groups, and the final theme demonstrated a focus on equal and individualised care. CONCLUSIONS: Policies introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic may have adversely impacted those from ethnic minority groups making these at-risk populations even more vulnerable. The palliative care response may have been equal but inequitable. During the para-COVID-19 period, systemic steps, including equality impact assessments, are urgently needed.},

abstract = {Background: There is lack of population level data on prevalence and distribution of common benign women's health conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, polycystic ovary syndrome from the Eastern Mediterranean region despite their significant consequences on quality of life. In particular, there is complete absence of any health statistics from Northern Cyprus, which is an emerging region in Europe. The Cyprus Women's Health Research (COHERE) Initiative is the first large-scale cross-sectional study in the region, aiming to determine the relative burden of benign women's health conditions and related co-morbidities in women living in Northern Cyprus. Methods: The COHERE Initiative is a cross-sectional study aiming to recruit 8000 women aged 18 55 years and residing for at least the past 5 years in Northern Cyprus. The study is composed of two main steps: (1) Baseline recruitment, including (i) completion of a detailed health questionnaire, which is an expanded version of the World Endometriosis Research Foundation (WERF) Endometriosis Phenome Harmonisation Project (EPHect) standardised questionnaire, including questions on demographics, menstrual history, hormone use, pregnancy, pain (pelvic pain, bladder and bowel pain, migraine), medical history, family history of illnesses, medication use, life-style factors in relation to a wide range of reproductive and endocrine conditions, resource use (ii) measurement of weight, height, waist/hip circumference and blood pressure, (iii) collection of saliva samples for genotyping. (2) Gynaecology clinic follow up, including a pelvic ultrasound scan (USS). There is also a follow-up food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) targeted to all women taking part in the baseline recruitment with an aim to collect more detailed data on dietary habits. Discussion: The COHERE Initiative will generate prevalence rates for conditions, define the clinical profiles for women's health conditions, and estimate the economic burden of these conditions in Northern Cyprus. The results will also provide insights into the current status of health-care among women living in a currently under-investigated region. The genetic findings will inform future gene mapping studies for investigation of the heritable component of conditions in this population/region. Moreover, the results will be compared with other centres collecting data using EPHect tools globally and will help determine population differences and similarities in disease patterns and clinical profiles. The COHERE Initiative will serve as a resource to conduct hypothesis-driven follow-up studies investigating effect of the Mediterranean life-style' as well as genetic factors on common benign women's health conditions that maybe specific to Eastern Mediterranean populations.},

abstract = {Background: As part of the process of developing an HD specific health-related quality of life instrument, we have conducted interviews with people living with HD. From this qualitative research, a long-list of items has been identified. The aim of this study was to investigate responses to these items arising directly from patient interviews, in a larger multinational sample of HD participants via an initial questionnaire (HDQ-D1). Methods: The HDQ-D1 questionnaire has 81 items, with a 3-point response scale. It asks participants how important each item is in terms of their quality of life (importance score), and also how often they experienced difficulty with each item (frequency score) in the last month. HDQ-D1 data from respondents across Europe (England, Ireland, Scotland, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland) and Canada were analysed. Participants fell into six consecutive disease stages, i.e. pre-symptomatic gene carriers, Stage I, Stage II, Stage III, Stage IV and Stage V. Analysis of variance was undertaken on HDQ-D1 items to examine any differences in scores (importance and frequency) over disease stage, followed by post-hoc tests with adjusted significance levels as appropriate. Results: Importance scores for the vast majority of items did not significantly differ across the six HD severity sub-groups, however frequency scores did. The pattern of change across participant sub-groups was examined and results regarding how items differed across the spectrum of HD stages (including pre-symptomatic HD) by stage of disease will be presented. Conclusions: Since all six disease stage sub-groups assigned similar importance values to almost all HDQ-D1 items, HD participants generally viewed the importance of the items similarly regardless of HD stage. However, when participants indicated how often they experienced difficulty with each item, disease stage was a key factor.},

abstract = {Background: Specialist palliative care services have various configurations of staff, processes and interventions, which determine how care is delivered. Currently, there is no consistent way to define and distinguish these different models of care. Aim: To identify the core components that characterise and differentiate existing models of specialist palliative care in the United Kingdom. Design: Mixed-methods study: (1) semi-structured interviews to identify criteria, (2) two-round Delphi study to rank/refine criteria, and (3) structured interviews to test/refine criteria. Setting/participants: Specialist palliative care stakeholders from hospice inpatient, hospital advisory, and community settings. (1) Semi-structured interviews with 14 clinical leads, from eight UK organisations (five hospice inpatient units, two hospital advisory teams, five community teams), provided 34 preliminary criteria. (2) Delphi study: Round 1 (54 participants): thirty-four criteria presented, seven removed and seven added. Round 2 (30 participants): these 34 criteria were ranked with the 15 highest ranked criteria, including setting, type of care, size of service, diagnoses, disciplines, mode of care, types of interventions, ‘out-of-hours' components (referrals, times, disciplines, mode of care, type of care), external education, use of measures, bereavement follow-up and complex grief provision. (3) Structured interviews with 21 UK service leads (six hospice inpatients, four hospital advisory and nine community teams) refined the criteria from (1) and (2), and provided four further contextual criteria (team purpose, funding, self-referral acceptance and discharge). Conclusion: Results: In this innovative study, we derive 20 criteria to characterise and differentiate models of specialist palliative care – a major paradigm shift to enable accurate reporting and comparison in practice and research.},

abstract = {Objectives: To identify factors associated with palliative care services being busier during Covid-19. Methods: Cross-sectional online survey of UK palliative care services (April to July 2020) (CovPall). Ethical approval was received from King's College London Research Ethics committee (LRS-19/20-18541). The primary outcome was change in busyness (five-point ordinal scale). Ordinal logistic regression investigated factors associated with the primary outcome. Results: Of 277 responses, 71 (26%) reported being a lot more busy, 62 (22%) slightly more, 53 (19%) about the same, 50 (18%) slightly less, and 28 (10%) much less busy. Increased business was associated with homecare services (odds ratio [OR] 1.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-3.25), nursing care at home (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.70-6.19), publicly managed services (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.11-4.34), Covid-19 cases (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01), and staff shortages (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.64-4.48). Conclusion: Services providing community care, and publicly managed services, may have been better able to respond to escalating needs during Covid-19. This has potential implications for both service delivery and funding models.},

@article{Karaderi2020,
abstract = {COVID-19 presentation is very heterogeneous across cases, and host factors are at the forefront for the variables affecting the disease manifestation. The immune system has emerged as a key determinant in shaping the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is mainly the deleterious unconstrained immune response, rather than the virus itself, which leads to severe cases of COVID-19 and the associated mortality. Genetic susceptibility to dysregulated immune response is highly likely to be among the host factors for adverse disease outcome. Given that such genetic susceptibility has also been observed in autoimmune diseases (ADs), a number of critical questions remain unanswered; whether individuals with ADs have a significantly different risk for COVID-19–related complications compared to the general population, and whether studies on the genetics of ADs can shed some light on the host factors in COVID-19. In this perspective, we discuss the host genetic factors, which have been under investigation in association with COVID-19 severity. We touch upon the intricate link between autoimmunity and COVID-19 pathophysiology. We put forth a number of autoimmune susceptibility genes, which have the potential to be additional host genetic factors for modifying the severity of COVID-19 presentation. In summary, host genetics at the intersection of ADs and COVID-19 may serve as a source for understanding the heterogeneity of COVID-19 severity, and hence, potentially holds a key in achieving effective strategies in risk group identification, as well as effective treatments.},

abstract = {Context: Evidence of symptom control outcomes in severe COVID is scant. Objectives: To determine changes in symptoms among people severely ill or dying with COVID supported by palliative care, and associations with treatments and survival. Methods: Multicentre cohort study of people with COVID across England and Wales supported by palliative care services, during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. We analysed clinical, demographic and survival data, symptom severity at baseline (referral to palliative care, first COVID assessment) and at three follow-up assessments using the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale – COVID version. Results: We included 572 patients from 25 services, mostly hospital support teams; 496 (87%) were newly referred to palliative care with COVID, 75 (13%) were already supported by palliative care when they contracted COVID. At baseline, patients had a mean of 2.4 co-morbidities, mean age 77 years, a mean of five symptoms, and were often bedfast or semiconscious. The most prevalent symptoms were: breathlessness, weakness/lack of energy, drowsiness, anxiety, agitation, confusion/delirium, and pain. Median time in palliative care was 46 hours; 77% of patients died. During palliative care, breathlessness, agitation, anxiety, delirium, cough, fever, pain, sore/dry mouth and nausea improved; drowsiness became worse. Common treatments were low dose morphine and midazolam. Having moderate to severe breathlessness, agitation and multimorbidity were associated with shorter survival. Conclusion: Symptoms of COVID quickly improved during palliative care. Breathlessness, agitation and multimorbidity could be used as triggers for timelier referral, and symptom guidance for wider specialities should build on treatments identified in this study.},

abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease for which there is no known cure. Proxy evaluation is relevant for HD as its manifestation might limit the ability of persons to report their health-related quality of life (HrQoL). This study explored patient-proxy ratings of HrQoL of persons at different stages of HD, and examined factors that may affect proxy ratings. A total of 105 patient-proxy pairs completed the Huntington's disease health-related quality of life questionnaire (HDQoL) and other established HrQoL measures (EQ-5D and SF-12v2). Proxy-patient agreement was assessed in terms of absolute level (mean ratings) and intraclass correlation. Proxies' ratings were at a similar level to patients' self-ratings on an overall Summary Score and on most of the six Specific Scales of the HDQoL. On the Specific Hopes and Worries Scale, proxies on average rated HrQoL as better than patients' self-ratings, while on both the Specific Cognitive Scale and Specific Physical and Functional Scale proxies tended to rate HrQoL more poorly than patients themselves. The patient's disease stage and mental wellbeing (SF-12 Mental Component scale) were the two factors that primarily affected proxy assessment. Proxy scores were strongly correlated with patients' self-ratings of HrQoL, on the Summary Scale and all Specific Scales. The patient-proxy correlation was lower for patients at moderate stages of HD compared to patients at early and advanced stages. The proxy report version of the HDQoL is a useful complementary tool to self-assessment, and a promising alternative when individual patients with advanced HD are unable to self-report. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract = {Context: The growth of patient reported outcome measures data in palliative care provides an opportunity for machine learning to identify patterns in patient responses signifying different phases of illness. Objectives: The study will explore if machine learning and network analysis can identify phases in patient palliative status through symptoms reported on the Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS). Methods: A partly cross-sectional and partially longitudinal observational study was undertaken using the Australasian Karnofsky Performance Scale (AKPS); Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS); Phase of Illness (POI). Patient palliative records (n = 1507, 65% stable, 20% unstable, 9% deteriorating, 2% terminal) from 804 adult patients enrolled in a New Zealand palliative care service were analysed using a combination of statistical, machine learning and network analysis techniques. Results: Data from IPOS showed considerable variation with phase. Also, network analysis showed clear associations between items by phase. Six machine learning techniques identified the most important variables for predicting possible transition between phases of illness. Network analysis for all patients showed that Poor Appetite and Loss of Energy were central IPOS items, with Loss of Energy linked to Drowsiness, Shortness of Breath and Lack of Mobility on the one hand, and Poor Appetite linked to Nausea, Vomiting, Constipation and Sore and Dry Mouth on the other. Conclusion: These preliminary results, when coupled with the latest technological developments in mobile apps and wearable technology, could point the way to increased use of digital therapeutics in continuous palliative care monitoring.},

abstract = {Background: A valid measure to describe the most important needs and concerns of people with life-threatening illnesses is missing in Cyprus. Our aim was to adapt and test the cross-cultural validity and responsiveness of the Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale (IPOS) in a cohort of Turkish speaking cancer patients. Methods: The IPOS (English) patient-reported measure was translated into Turkish following published guidelines including, 2 independent forward, 2 independent blind backward translations, expert panel review by 7 members and field testing with 11 cognitive interviews (5 patients and 6 specialists) and final approval of the copyright holder. Consecutive cancer patients (n = 234) seen by the community palliative care services were recruited from Help Those with Cancer Society (KHYD); of those 82 were followed-up. The instrument was administered by personal interview. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to validate the factor structure of Turkish IPOS. Internal consistency reliability of the subscales was evaluated by Cronbach's alpha and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient respectively. Validity was assessed by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between Turkish IPOS scores and Turkish version of EQ-5D-3L - a validated generic measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group. Results: Turkish IPOS is conceptually and semantically equivalent to the English version and linguistically valid. The CFA was inconclusive for the three factor structure due to low sample size, as the SRMR and CFI tests only approached the defined minimums warranting further investigation. There were low levels of missing values, and no ceiling or floor effects. The Physical ($\alpha$ = 0.91) and the Social and Quality of Care Issues ($\alpha$ = 0.75) sub-scales showed good internal consistencies, however Emotional sub-scale showed poor internal consistency ($\alpha$ = 0.64). The reliability of the Physical (ICC = 0.51, 0.45-0.56 95% CI) and Social Quality of Care Issues (ICC = 0.50, 0.42-0.57 95% CI) were moderate. Poor internal consistency ($\alpha$ =0.64) and reliability (ICC = 0.31, 0.24-0.39, 95% CI) was obtained for Emotional Subscale. Construct validity was evidenced through significant correlations in the predicted directions and strength with EQ-5D. Turkish IPOS showed higher needs and concerns in participants at more advanced stages than those at earlier stages of cancer. The standardized response mean (SRM) of - 0.94 suggested large internal responsiveness to clinical change. Conclusion: Turkish IPOS is a clear, relevant, acceptable measure and responsive to the needs and concerns of cancer patients, observing regional differences, it may have implications for use in other Turkish speaking communities. Future studies are needed to clarify the factor structure, assess its external responsiveness and to improve the properties of its Emotional subscale.},

abstract = {Background: Palliative care and hospice services responded to the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is not clear how their workload has been affected. Aim: To identify factors associated with busyness in UK palliative care services during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: Online survey of clinical leads of palliative care services to understand the palliative care response to COVID-19 (CovPall). Study population characteristics were described. Unadjusted and multivariable ordinal logistic regression investigated factors (type of service, management type, number of confirmed (by test) Covid-19 cases, region, staff shortages) associated with busyness. Busyness was measured using a five-point scale (a lot less busy, slightly less busy, about the same, slightly more busy, a lot more busy). Results: 277 UK respondents: 33 Scotland, 4 Northern Ireland, 15 Wales, 225 in nine regions of England. Services reported being a lot more busy (71, 26%), slightly more busy (62, 22%), about the same (53, 19%), slightly less busy (50, 18%), much less busy (28, 10%). Multivariable analysis showed the following factors were associated with increased busyness: being a specialist palliative home care service (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.15-3.25), providing hands on nursing care at home or in the community (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.70-6.19), confirmed number (by test) Covid-19 cases (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01), being a publicly managed (NHS) service (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.11-4.34), and experiencing staff shortages (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.64-4.48). Conclusion: Community services and those publicly managed (NHS services) experienced increased busyness during Covid-19 pandemic. This suggests these services may have been more able to shift resources to respond to increased needs and changing patient priorities during the pandemic. This has implications for future funding models for palliative care.},

Aims This study compares patient self-report of health-related quality of life, with that of their companion's/carer's proxy report of the patient's health-related quality of life. Methods Data from a hundred and five pairs of persons living with Huntington's disease and their companions/carers contributed to this study. Patients were at different stages of Huntington's disease, ranging from at risk and gene positive presymptomatic individuals, to late stage disease. Results Analyses showed that Patient-Proxy agreement was substantial to excellent for the Summary Scale score of the HDQoL, and also for most of its Specific Scales. There was a tendency for proxies to over-estimate internal emotional aspects of patients' health related quality of life as better than patients' own ratings, while on more external physical and cognitive aspects the reverse was true. Conclusions The proxy report version of the HDQoL is a useful complementary tool to patient HDQoL self-report, and appears to be a promising alternative when patients may be unable to self-report.},

abstract = {Background/aims: Governments must meet the requirements of Universal Health Coverage to provide palliative care as an essential health service. It is important to ensure that measurable quality indicators underpin diverse models across international health systems, and that outcomes are demonstrated for patients and families. The study aim is to describe and evaluate models and quality indicators of palliative care across all 6 WHO regions, in terms of structure, process, and outcomes. Methods: Design: Mixed methods longitudinal study of newly referred palliative care adult patients and their families with embedded qualitative interviews. Convenience sampling was applied. Setting: Belarus, Jamaica, Oman, Thailand, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe. Methods: Phase of illness was measured and monthly Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS) and Client Services Receipt Inventory. Analysis: Comparative tabulation of service proforma; assessment of psychometric properties of outcome tool; descriptive analysis of service use; thematic analysis of qualitative interview data. Results: N=741 patients, mean 58.6 years old, majority digestive organs cancer. Internal consistency of IPOS (Cronbach a=0.78) and test-retest reliability (canonical correlation=0.76) were confirmed. Patterns of health service use differed by country due to variation in healthcare resources and systems. From 54 qualitative interviews, 4 care domains (good physical symptom management, adequate psychological support, respecting social norm, and trusting relationship) and 5 system indicators (information provision, friendly environment, adequate funding, communication and continuous care, and shared decision-making) were identified for quality palliative care. Conclusions: Despite vast heterogeneity in service models and samples, it is possible to identify core outcomes and measure these, and define quality cross-nationally. We support locally-led additional quality indicators to ensure contextual relevance.},

Addressing difficulties patients encounter while seeking reimbursement from their national health service or health insurer and reducing the number of adverse events patients experience when receiving healthcare improves policy efficiency. Conclusion: Our findings confirm that there is country-level variation in cross-border healthcare policy efficiency.},

There are limitations in the use of generic health related quality of life scales. The patient-derived Huntington's Disease health-related Quality of Life questionnaire (HDQoL) is a new disease-specific HrQoL questionnaire which aims to capture the true impact of HD across disease severity. Aims This study examines the psychometric properties of the Huntington's Disease health-related Quality of Life questionnaire (HDQoL). Methods A hundred and fifty two participants living with HD participated in this study, comprising at risk and gene positive presymptomatic individuals, as well as the full range of symptomatic participants. Participants completed the HDQoL, together with generic quality of life instruments, that is, SF-36 and EQ-5D. A subset of participants completed the HDQoL for a second time several weeks later. Results The HDQoL scales demonstrate good test-retest reliability, construct validity, and scale acceptability. Its scales have acceptable measurement and psychometric properties reflecting the broad spectrum of patients and participants in this sample. Conclusions The validated HDQoL scales provide promising patient reported outcome measures specifically for HD.},

abstract = {Background: Culturally relevant patient-centered outcomes tools are needed to identify the needs of patients and to assess their palliative care concerns. Aim: To translate and culturally adapt the Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS) into Hindi. Design: The study applied a standardized methodology entailing six phases for translation and content validation: equivalence setting through a three-step process; forward translation; blind backward translation; expert review by a panel of the POS team; cognitive de-briefing with patients; and proof-reading of the final tool. All interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using content analysis. Setting/participants: (1) Healthcare professionals including doctors, nurses, psychologists, counselors, and volunteers working in Indian palliative care settings with expertise in both English and Hindi languages; (2) Hindi speaking patients diagnosed with cancer who were receiving palliative care in community settings. Caregivers, palliative care experts, and language translators contributed to the translation procedure. Results: Phrases like nausea, poor appetite, drowsiness, and depression were difficult to translate into Hindi. Response categories “occasional” and “sometimes” were overlapping. All items, instructions and response categories were simple to understand. A visual thermometer is a unique feature of Hindi IPOS to facilitate responses from less educated patients. Conclusion: Hindi IPOS has face and content validity for use in clinical practice and research. The Hindi IPOS has implications beyond Indian palliative care settings. Millions of Hindi speakers can now respond to IPOS, and have a tool for communicating their palliative care needs in their mother tongue to inform patient-centered care.},

abstract = {Purpose: To examine research participants' levels of satisfaction and
perceptions and aid researchers to better engage research volunteers
from all racial and ethnic populations in clinical trials. A participant
satisfaction survey was developed that focused on three domains to
reflect satisfaction with delivery of care, environment, and center
operations. In addition, the survey contained open-ended questions to
reflect overall experiences and perceptions. Two hundred and
seventy-eight participants (55% African American and 29% non-Hispanic
Whites) with an average age of 52 years completed the survey. Results:
The results indicated that the majority of the participants rated their
satisfaction very highly across all domains. Ninety percent stated they
were very satisfied/satisfied or very strongly agreed/agreed in the
three domains. Obtaining high-quality care/access to health care
professionals (60%), learning more about their illness/disease (60%),
and helping others (57%) were noted as important factors in choosing to
participate in a trial. Regarding overall experience, majority of
respondents stated that friendliness, expertise of staff, learning more
about their disease, and contributing to science were important.
Further, financial compensation was not a primary motivation for
participation. A majority of participants stated that they would
participate in future studies and would recommend a friend or a family
member to participate in clinical trials. Conclusions: The findings
indicate that the degree of satisfaction with the research staff and
with the specific trial itself are important determinants for enrolling,
completing a study, and for participating in future trials.},

abstract = {Background: As patient satisfaction scores become increasingly relevant in today's health care market, we sought to evaluate satisfaction of the unique subset of patients enrolling in clinical trials in a research facility embedded within a community hospital system. Methods: We developed and deployed a patient satisfaction survey tailored to clinical trial patients who consented to and/or completed a clinical trial in our research institute in the prior year. The survey was distributed to 222 patients. Likert scale responses were analyzed using top box and percentile rank procedures. Correlation analysis was used to evaluate associations between the clinical trial experience and intent to return to our system for routine care. Results: Ninety surveys were returned in the 6 months following the mailing for a 41 % response rate; the bulk of these (N = 81) were returned within 6 weeks of the mailing. The questions with the highest ranking responses were related to interactions with staff (84th percentile or higher). Fifty-one point one percent of patients (64th percentile) strongly agreed that they would seek future care in our system. Patient intent to return to the provider seen during the clinical trial was most highly correlated with intent to seek future care within our system (r = 0.54, p < 0.0001). Reasons cited for clinical trial enrollment were generally altruistic. Conclusions: Querying this special patient population is feasible and yields valuable insight into their experience with healthcare system-based clinical trials and the relationship between clinical trial participation and perception of the healthcare system as a desirable resource for routine medical care. We argue that this work is invaluable to the research community and submit a call to action to our peers to begin systematic evaluation of clinical trial patient satisfaction.},

Methods To address this limitation, we developed shorter RPPS-Ultrashort and RPPS-Short versions, fielded them with the RPPS-Long to a random sample of a national research volunteer registry, and assessed response and completion rates, test/retest reliability, and demographics. Results In total, 2228 eligible registry members received survey links. Response rates were 64% (RPPS-Ultrashort), 63% (RPPS-Short), and 51% (RPPS-Long), respectively (p<0.001). Completion rates were 63%, 54%, and 37%, respectively (p<0.001). All surveys were reliable with Cronbach $\alpha$=0.81, 0.84, and 0.87, respectively. Retest reliability was highest for RPPS-short ($\kappa$=0.85). Provision of compensation increased RPPS-short completion rate from 54% to 71% (p<0.001). Compensated respondents were younger (p<0.001), with greater minority representation (p=0.03). Conclusions Shorter surveys were reliable and produced higher response and completion rates then long surveys.

Summary of key points Based on a consensus exercise informed by reviews and qualitative interviews, we present key principles and actions for consideration when developing interventions to improve health. These include seeing intervention development as a dynamic iterative process, involving stakeholders, reviewing published research evidence, drawing on existing theories, articulating programme theory, undertaking primary data collection, understanding context, paying attention to future implementation in the real world and designing and refining an intervention using iterative cycles of development with stakeholder input throughout.

Conclusion Researchers should consider each action by addressing its relevance to a specific intervention in a specific context, both at the start and throughout the development process.},

PPI is defined as research being carried out ‘with' or ‘by' patients and members of the public rather than ‘to', ‘about' or ‘for' them (http://www.invo.org.uk/). Patient involvement is different from collecting data from patients as participants. Ethical considerations also differ. PPI is about patients actively contributing through discussion to decisions about research design, acceptability, relevance, conduct and governance from study conception to dissemination. Occasionally patients lead or do research. The research methods of PPI range from informal discussions to partnership research approaches such as action research, co-production and co-learning. This article discusses how researchers can involve patients when they are applying for research funding and considers some opportunities and pitfalls. It reviews research funder requirements, draws on the literature and our collective experiences as clinicians, patients, academics and members of UK funding panels.},

abstract = {Objective: To develop recommendations for promoting uptake of and adherence to falls-prevention interventions among older people. Design: The recommendations were initially developed from literature review, clinical experience of the core group members, and substantial qualitative and quantitative studies of older people's views. They were refined through a consultation process with members of the falls-prevention community, drawing on Delphi survey and nominal group techniques. Transparency was enhanced by recording and reporting aspects of the iterative consultation process such as the degree of consensus and critical comments on drafts of the recommendations. Setting: The recommendations were developed and refined at three meetings of the core group, and through internet-based consultation and two meetings involving members of the wider falls-prevention community. Participants: The authors developed the recommendations incorporating the feedback from the researchers and practitioners responding to a broad-based internet consultation and consulted in the meetings. Results: A high degree of consensus was achieved. Recommendations addressed the need for public education, ensuring that interventions were compatible with a positive identity, tailoring interventions to the specific situation and values of the individual, and using validated methods to maintain longer-term adherence. Conclusion: These recommendations represent a consensus based on current knowledge and evidence, but the evidence base from which these recommendations were developed was limited, and not always specific to prevention of falls. To increase the effectiveness of falls-prevention interventions, further research is needed to identify the features of falls-prevention programmes that will encourage older people's engagement in them.},

abstract = {Current methods for producing clinical guidelines are cumbersome and not always reliable. Could a more streamlined approach improve coverage and make decisions more transparent? Clinical guidelines are rarely based solely on research evidence. In most cases they also incorporate the consensus views of experts. Despite recognition of the need for rigour in developing a consensus, current approaches often lack sufficient transparency, fail to make clear what influence the level of resources in the health system has, lack sufficient reliability, and will never achieve comprehensive and timely coverage of the whole range of health care. We propose a new approach that we believe will be more cost effective and that could meet these challenges. Most professional societies and national agencies in North America, Australia, and Europe recognise that guidelines cannot be based on research evidence alone. To paraphrase the philosopher David Hume: “ought” statements such as guidelines cannot be constructed from “is” statements such as research evidence.1 The conversion from is to ought inevitably introduces value judgments about underlying goals and, in this context, somewhat subjective assessments of the quality of the research evidence and its relevance for particular patients and settings. The recognised need to go beyond the often limited research evidence has led to the use of expert consensus in developing guidelines. The assumption is that the views of a group have greater validity and reliability than the judgment of an individual. In addition, formal or structured methods for developing a consensus have advantages over informal committees: they should offer more transparent ways of synthesising individual judgments, can reduce the influence of dominating personalities and “group think,” and can provide valuable information on the extent and reasons for differences of opinion.2 Since there can be no standard for checking the validity of a consensus based guideline, we {\ldots}},

abstract = {Introduction The Nominal Group Technique (NGT) and Delphi Technique are consensus methods used in research that is directed at problem-solving, idea-generation, or determining priorities. While consensus methods are commonly used in health services literature, few studies in pharmacy practice use these methods. This paper provides an overview of the NGT and Delphi technique, including the steps involved and the types of research questions best suited to each method, with examples from the pharmacy literature. Methodology The NGT entails face-to-face discussion in small groups, and provides a prompt result for researchers. The classic NGT involves four key stages: silent generation, round robin, clarification and voting (ranking). Variations have occurred in relation to generating ideas, and how ‘consensus' is obtained from participants. The Delphi technique uses a multistage self-completed questionnaire with individual feedback, to determine consensus from a larger group of ‘experts.' Questionnaires have been mailed, or more recently, e-mailed to participants. When to use The NGT has been used to explore consumer and stakeholder views, while the Delphi technique is commonly used to develop guidelines with health professionals. Method choice is influenced by various factors, including the research question, the perception of consensus required, and associated practicalities such as time and geography. Limitations The NGT requires participants to personally attend a meeting. This may prove difficult to organise and geography may limit attendance. The Delphi technique can take weeks or months to conclude, especially if multiple rounds are required, and may be complex for lay people to complete.},

@article{NIHRINVOLVE2015,
abstract = {In 2013 INVOLVE reviewed literature, publications and reports2 that looked at values, principles and standards for public involvement in research3. An INVOLVE Advisory Group was brought together in 2014 to consider adapting the findings from the review into a draft framework4 to identify and reflect on good practice, which was then put out for wider comment and discussion. This revised version of the framework reflects the extensive feedback received from this exercise, including two key conceptual changes to previous drafts5. These are:  The examples for each of the six values have been redefined to illustrate principles in practice for each value rather than setting out standards and examples of standards in action. The reasons for this are that, given that the framework is still in development, it was considered pre-emptive to be establishing standards at this stage of the process.  In earlier versions of the framework, the heading for Value 5 was ‘Diversity'. This heading has now been changed to ‘Fairness of opportunity' to better reflect the purpose of this specific value and to emphasise that the term ‘diversity', alongside the terms ‘equality' and ‘inclusion', as defined in the Equality Act 2010, are overarching ideals within which all six values of this framework must be situated.6},

abstract = {Introduction Patient and public involvement (PPI) has not been used to its full potential when examining the organisational science and management principles side of healthcare. With more and more acknowledgement of the relationship between management tools and patient outcomes, having meaningful engagement with the patient and the public in conducting research with the potential to enhance the patient experience, has never been more important. This study aims to outline the process in identifying members for a PPI for the organisational science and management principles side of healthcare, as well as providing guidelines for the establishment of PPIs in this nascent field. In addition, it aims to produce a charter for the panel, by and with the panel members, ensuring they are involved at every stage of research.

Methods and analysis A hybrid of both a priority-setting and partnership approach to PPI will provide guidance on identifying, recruiting and establishing a PPI for research on the organisational science and management principles in healthcare. The panel will consist of approximately 20 members including patients, members of the public and researchers. A World Caf{\'{e}} approach to panel workshops will be adopted to produce a charter for the group. An assessment of panel engagement will be conducted through analysis of records of the meetings/workshops, as well as one-to-one interviews with all panel members at key points in time. Assessment criteria will be agreed with all members of the PPI panel. Data will be transcribed and managed using NVivo through a thematic analysis.

Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval for the evaluation of the PPI has been received from the Kemmy Business School's Ethics Committee. Papers outlining the process in establishing a PPI in the area of organisational science and management principles of healthcare, and the results of the assessment of the panel's engagement will be published in journals.

@article{Greenhalgh2019,
abstract = {Background: Numerous frameworks for supporting, evaluating and reporting patient and public involvement in research exist. The literature is diverse and theoretically heterogeneous. Objectives: To identify and synthesize published frameworks, consider whether and how these have been used, and apply design principles to improve usability. Search strategy: Keyword search of six databases; hand search of eight journals; ancestry and snowball search; requests to experts. Inclusion criteria: Published, systematic approaches (frameworks) designed to support, evaluate or report on patient or public involvement in health-related research. Data extraction and synthesis: Data were extracted on provenance; collaborators and sponsors; theoretical basis; lay input; intended user(s) and use(s); topics covered; examples of use; critiques; and updates. We used the Canadian Centre for Excellence on Partnerships with Patients and Public (CEPPP) evaluation tool and hermeneutic methodology to grade and synthesize the frameworks. In five co-design workshops, we tested evidence-based resources based on the review findings. Results: Our final data set consisted of 65 frameworks, most of which scored highly on the CEPPP tool. They had different provenances, intended purposes, strengths and limitations. We grouped them into five categories: power-focused; priority-setting; study-focused; report-focused; and partnership-focused. Frameworks were used mainly by the groups who developed them. The empirical component of our study generated a structured format and evidence-based facilitator notes for a “build your own framework” co-design workshop. Conclusion: The plethora of frameworks combined with evidence of limited transferability suggests that a single, off-the-shelf framework may be less useful than a menu of evidence-based resources which stakeholders can use to co-design their own frameworks.},

abstract = {Introduction Public and patient involvement (PPI) in healthcare decisions at the health system-level (macro-level) has become increasingly important during recent years. Existing evidence indicates that PPI increase patient centredness and the democracy of healthcare decisions as well as patients' trust and acceptance of these decisions. However, different methods for PPI exist, and an overview of the outcomes and influential contextual factors has not yet been conducted. Therefore, this scoping review aims to provide an overview of the different methods used for PPI in health system decisionmaking and the reported outcomes and contextual factors for these methods. Methods and analysis The structure of this protocol is guided by the advanced scoping studies framework of Arksey and O' Malley, developed by Levac, Colquhoun and O'Brien, and the PRISMA-ScR Statement. We will systematically search electronic databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINAHL, PDQ-Evidence, Web of Science and PsycINFO) for peer-reviewed literature and screen the reference lists of included studies. Additionally, we will search for relevant grey literature and consult experts from the field to identify further information. Studies focusing on PPI in the context of health policy decision-making at the macro-level will be eligible for full-text screening. Studies focusing on decisions at the individual treatment-level (micro-level) and the organisational-level (mesolevel) as well as those dealing with PPI in health research will be excluded. A qualitative analysis will dissect how the included studies define PPI and its desirable outcomes, the achieved outcomes and reported contextual factors. Ethics and dissemination We will present the results at relevant conferences and in an open-access journal. Additionally, we will share them with the experts involved in the research process and consider ways in which to transfer the findings into practice. As only secondary and previously published information will be used, ethical approval is not necessary.},

abstract = {This is a new edition of the briefing notes for researchers. Whilst some of the content is drawn from earlier editions this document is substantially different in both its format (available as an online resource) and its content, reflecting the changing environment since the original briefing notes were written in 2004. The number of resources for public involvement in research have increased substantially, including those provided by INVOLVE such as the online Evidence Library and Putting it into Practice Database, those available through other National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded initiatives, and through the Research Councils and various research charities. Public involvement in research sits in a changing and evolving environment. There is now a greater commitment to the importance and contribution public involvement can make to research and there are far more organisations and individuals supporting public involvement. There are also many more researchers and research commissioners working alongside the public for the first time. We have restructured some of our thinking about the framework for public involvement in research. In the past we have used the terms consultation, collaboration and user controlled to describe different levels of involving people in research. Over time it has become clear that in practice researchers can use a combination of these three and it is more helpful to describe them as approaches rather than levels. This publication aims to provide an introduction for those new to public involvement. The briefing notes have been developed as part of a larger online resource which includes more detailed information in the form of supplements, examples and templates. Within this publication briefing note three will help you to think through your framework for public involvement and briefing note five provides practical information for planning your public involvement.},

Particularly strong evidence has been presented with regard to the impact that PPIE has in certain research areas, such as mental health. Involving the public in mental health research has the potential to improve the quality of research and reduce the power imbalance between researchers and participants. However, limitations can be frequent and include tokenistic involvement and lack of infrastructure and support. Nevertheless, PPIE has the potential to impact mental health research in the Latin American context, where existing policies already support public involvement in health research and where the burden of mental disorders is significant. There are many lessons to learn from the evidence of PPIE in other regions. Latin America now has the opportunity to tackle one of today's most important issues: Effective health care service delivery for all, based on evidence from comprehensive health research.},

@article{Gamble2015,
abstract = {Background: In comparison with other study designs, randomised trials are regarded as particularly likely to benefit from patient and public involvement (PPI). Using mixed-methods research we investigated PPI from the perspectives of researchers and PPI contributors.; Methods: Randomised trials in receipt of funding from the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme between 2006 and 2010 were identified. Funding applications and board and referee comments were obtained and data relevant to PPI extracted. Chief investigators (CIs), PPI contributors and UK Clinical Research Collaboration Registered Clinical Trials Units (RCTUs) were surveyed. Interviews were conducted with researchers and PPI contributors.; Results: A total of 111 trials were included. Text relevant to PPI was identified in half of the trials for which the first-stage applications were available, but only one-quarter described PPI within their development. In the second stage of the application, the majority provided some text relevant to PPI, with over half having PPI in their development. Fewer than half of referees commented on PPI, and funding boards rarely provided comments in relation to PPI. Seventy-three per cent (81 of 111) of CIs responded to the survey and 98% (79 of 81) included PPI at some stage in their trial. CIs considered high impact from PPI contributors to occur more frequently in trial setup, with low or no impact being more common during trial conduct, analysis and dissemination. Only one-third of CIs provided PPI contributor contact details but all contributors contacted completed the survey. The majority of contributors felt engaged and valued by the research team. Interviews were conducted with researchers and/or PPI contributors for 28 trials identifying two main influences on perception of PPI impact: whether or not CIs expressed personal goals and plans for PPI; and the quality of their relationship with the PPI contributors. The importance of early engagement was identified, with opportunity for input thereafter limited. Three PPI roles were identified: oversight, managerial and responsive. Oversight roles, as required by funders, were associated with low impact in comparison with responsive or managerial roles. Most researchers could see some value in PPI training for researchers, although those that had received such training themselves expressed concerns about its purpose and evidence base. Training for PPI contributors was considered unnecessary, with conversational approaches preferred, although this did not appear to provide an opportunity for role negotiation. The RCTU survey response rate was 85% (39 of 46). The majority (37 of 39) reported PPI within trials co-ordinated by their unit. Trial characteristics were used by half to determine the approach to PPI. Two-thirds reported recent developments or changes in implementing plans for PPI (21 of 33). Support to PPI contributors was commonly offered through members of staff at the unit.; Conclusions: PPI is occurring in the majority of trials funded by the HTA programme, but uncertainty remains about how it is assessed and valued. Early involvement, building a relationship between researchers and contributors, responsive or managerial roles, and having defined goals for PPI were associated with impact. Efficiency could be gained by utilising the RCTU network to identify and tackle challenges, and develop a risk-based approach utilising trial characteristics. Recommendations are made to trial funders and the research community. Given the difficulties for some informants in recalling PPI contributions, future research using a prospective approach would be valuable. Ethnographic research that combines observation and multi-informant interviews is likely to be informative in identifying impact. The research community needs to give further consideration to processes for selecting PPI contributors and models of implementing PPI.; Funding: The National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research programme and INVOLVE.; Copyright {\textcopyright} Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2015.

abstract = {Background Patient and public involvement (PPI) in research is increasingly a funder requirement due to the potential benefits in the design of relevant, participant friendly, ethically sound research. The use and sharing of resources can benefit PPI, but available resources are not consistently used leading to duplication of effort. This paper describes a developing toolkit to support clinical trials teams to undertake effective and meaningful PPI. Methods The first phase in developing the toolkit was to describe which PPI activities should be considered in the pathway of a clinical trial and at what stage these activities should take place. This pathway was informed through review of the type and timing of PPI activities within trials coordinated by the Clinical Trials Research Centre and previously described areas of potential PPI impact in trials. In the second phase, key websites around PPI and identification of resources opportunistically, e.g. in conversation with other trialists or social media, were used to identify resources. Tools were developed where gaps existed. Results A flowchart was developed describing PPI activities that should be considered in the clinical trial pathway and the point at which these activities should happen. Three toolkit domains were identified: planning PPI; supporting PPI; recording and evaluating PPI. Four main activities and corresponding tools were identified under the planning for PPI: developing a plan; identifying patient and public contributors; allocating appropriate costs; and managing expectations. In supporting PPI, tools were developed to review participant information sheets. These tools, which require a summary of potential trial participant characteristics and circumstances help to clarify requirements and expectations of PPI review. For recording and evaluating PPI, the planned PPI interventions should be monitored in terms of impact, and a tool to monitor public contributor experience is in development. Conclusions This toolkit provides a developing ‘off the shelf' resource to support trial teams with limited resources in undertaking PPI. Key activities in further developing and maintaining the toolkit are to: listen to the views and experience of both research teams and public contributors using the tools, to identify the need for future tools, to modify tools based on experience of their use; to update the toolkit based on any newly identified resources that come to light; to raise awareness of the toolkit and to work in collaboration with others to both develop and test out PPI resources in order to reduce duplication of work in PPI.},

abstract = {Background: While the patient and public involvement (PPI) evidence base has expanded over the past decade, the quality of reporting within papers is often inconsistent, limiting our understanding of how it works, in what context, for whom, and why. Objective: To develop international consensus on the key items to report to enhance the quality, transparency, and consistency of the PPI evidence base. To collaboratively involve patients as research partners at all stages in the development of GRIPP2. Methods: The EQUATOR method for developing reporting guidelines was used. The original GRIPP (Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public) checklist was revised, based on updated systematic review evidence. A three round Delphi survey was used to develop consensus on items to be included in the guideline. A subsequent face-to-face meeting produced agreement on items not reaching consensus during the Delphi process. Results: 143 participants agreed to participate in round one, with an 86% (123/143) response for round two and a 78% (112/143) response for round three. The Delphi survey identified the need for long form (LF) and short form (SF) versions. GRIPP2-LF includes 34 items on aims, definitions, concepts and theory, methods, stages and nature of involvement, context, capture or measurement of impact, outcomes, economic assessment, and reflections and is suitable for studies where the main focus is PPI. GRIPP2-SF includes five items on aims, methods, results, outcomes, and critical perspective and is suitable for studies where PPI is a secondary focus. Conclusions: GRIPP2-LF and GRIPP2-SF represent the first international evidence based, consensus informed guidance for reporting patient and public involvement in research. Both versions of GRIPP2 aim to improve the quality, transparency, and consistency of the international PPI evidence base, to ensure PPI practice is based on the best evidence.

@article{Carroll2021,
abstract = {Introduction: Patient and public involvement (PPI) aims to improve the quality, relevance, and appropriateness of research and ensure that it meets the needs and expectations of those affected by particular conditions to the greatest possible degree. The evidence base for the positive impact of PPI on clinical research continues to grow, but the role of PPI in preclinical research (an umbrella term encompassing ‘basic', ‘fundamental', ‘translational' or ‘lab-based' research) remains limited. As funding bodies and policymakers continue to increase emphasis on the relevance of PPI to preclinical research, it is timely to map the PPI literature to support preclinical researchers involving the public, patients, or other service users in their research. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review is to explore the literature on patient and public involvement in preclinical research from any discipline. Methods: This scoping review will search the literature in Medline (PubMed), Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and OpenGrey.net to explore the application of PPI in preclinical research. This review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines for scoping reviews. It will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Two reviewers will independently review articles for inclusion in the final review. Data extraction will be guided by the research questions. The PPI advisory panel will then collaboratively identify themes in the extracted data. Discussion: This scoping review will provide a map of current evidence surrounding preclinical PPI, and identify the body of literature on this topic, which has not been comprehensively reviewed to date. Findings will inform ongoing work of the research team, support the work of other preclinical researchers aiming to include PPI in their own research, and identify knowledge and practice gaps. Areas for future research will be identified.},

abstract = {Objectives: We conducted two studies to examine the dimensions, internal consistency reliability estimates, and potential correlates of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). Method: Participants in Study 1 included 887 undergraduate students (363 men and 524 women, aged 18 to 35 years; mean [M] age = 19.46, standard deviation [SD] = 2.17) recruited from two public universities to assess the specificity of the individual DASS-21 items and to evaluate estimates of internal consistency reliability. Participants in a follow-up study (Study 2) included 410 students (168 men and 242 women, aged 18 to 47 years; M age = 19.65, SD = 2.88) recruited from the same universities to further assess factorial validity and to evaluate potential correlates of the original DASS-21 total and scale scores. Results: Item bifactor and confirmatory factor analyses revealed that a general factor accounted for the greatest proportion of common variance in the DASS-21 item scores (Study 1). In Study 2, the fit statistics showed good fit for the bifactor model. In addition, the DASS-21 total scale score correlated more highly with scores on a measure of mixed depression and anxiety than with scores on the proposed specific scales of depression or anxiety. Coefficient omega estimates for the DASS-21 scale scores were good. Conclusions: Further investigations of the bifactor structure and psychometric properties of the DASS-21, specifically its incremental and discriminant validity, using known clinical groups are needed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Method: Cross-sectional study of psychological distress measured through the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) in a sample of 1074 college students. Results: We found a moderate prevalence of depression (18,4%), anxiety (23,6%) and stress (34,5%) symptoms in our study population. Being <21, having problematic Internet use behavior, smoking, presenting insomnia and having a low self-esteem were independently associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. Being a woman, living with their family, having a stable partner, consuming alcohol frequently and having poor nutritional habits were significantly associated with symptoms of stress; lacking a stable partner was significantly associated with depressive symptoms; and frequent consumption of alcohol was significantly associated with symptoms of anxiety. Conclusion: We found a moderate prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in our population. Interventions aimed at promoting mental health among college students should be implemented.},

abstract = {Examples 3 and 4 present comments to the authors and editor for a hypothetical study on the diagnostic accuracy of interleukin-9 in prostate cancer. In each set of comments I have followed the 6 "Be's" to success. I tried to be cognizant of my roles as a peer reviewer. I separated my comments to the editor from those to the authors. I created a review that first summarized the manuscript and then separated my major comments and concerns from those related to the presentation or clarity of the text. Wherever possible, I identified the page associated with my comment. I tried to be specific in my comments so the authors could understand exactly what I was talking about, and I tried to be helpful even while telling the authors about the limitations I saw in the study. I provided references to support my opinions. My recommendation to the editor was supported by my comments to the authors. My messages to the authors and the editor were consistent. Above all, I attempted to be considerate of the authors in how I expressed my comments and concerns. Your first responsibility as a peer reviewer is to thoroughly evaluate the science in a manuscript. You do not want bad science to end up in the literature. Your second responsibility is to compose an effective peer review that meets the needs of both the editor and the authors. The time involved in composing a peer review can be nearly as long as the time spent in evaluating the manuscript, but if you apply the 6 "Be's" I have described, you should be able to meet that second responsibility successfully.},

The writing starts with making figures and tables. These suggest several terse summary statements, the few major conclusions or observations the author will present to the scientific community. After identification of the audience, the specific community addressed, materials and methods are written to explain how the tables and figures were generated. Results are initially restricted to describing the logical data relations in each table and figure. The discussion then converts each data relationship into mechanistic cause-and-effect interpretations suitable for the abstract. A brief epilogue deals with the submission and the fate of the final manuscript once submitted. Although other models for the initial draft exist, this model has worked for us and new researchers in our laboratories and addresses problems we encountered while editing manuscripts. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.},

The key to getting manuscripts accepted is to make them understandable and informative so that your colleagues will read and benefit from them. We describe key criteria for acceptance of manuscripts and outline a multi-step process for writing the manuscript. The likelihood that a manuscript will be accepted by a major journal is significantly increased if the manuscript is written in polished and fluent scientific English. Although scientific quality is the most important consideration, clear and concise writing often makes the difference between acceptance and rejection. As with any skill, efficient writing of high-quality manuscripts comes with experience and repetition. It is very uncommon for a manuscript to be accepted as submitted to a journal. Thoughtful and respectful responses to the journal reviewers' comments are critical. Success in scientific writing, as in surgery, is dependent on effort, repetition, and commitment. The transfer of knowledge through a well-written publication in a high-quality medical journal will have an impact not only in your own institution and country, but also throughout the world.},

We suggest considering scientific writing as a team enterprise, which needs proper organization and regular feedback. In addition, it is helpful to select potential target journals early and to consider not only scope and reputation, but also decision times and rejection rates. Before submission, instructions to authors and writing guides should be considered, and drafts should be extensively revised. Later in the process editor's and reviewer's comments should be followed.

The inclusion of gender-diverse study populations has improved, but the reporting of sex and gender variables in research is still incomplete. The Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines, published in 2016, have been widely endorsed, but few scientific journals and organizations have incorporated them into formal editorial guidance and publication policies. To facilitate monitoring of and adherence to the SAGER guidelines in Lancet journals, we carried out an informal pilot study and developed a checklist to enable rapid editorial checks, promote uptake of the guidelines by other editors and journals, and raise awareness among peer reviewers and authors. By using this checklist as part of manuscript assessment and peer-review processes, journal editors can support best reporting practices when considering sex and gender as variables, improving the generalizability of the research they publish.},

This oversight limits the generalizability of research findings and their applicability to clinical practice, in particular for women but also for men. This article describes the rationale for an international set of guidelines to encourage a more systematic approach to the reporting of sex and gender in research across disciplines. Methods A panel of 13 experts representing nine countries developed the guidelines through a series of teleconferences, conference presentations and a 2-day workshop. An internet survey of 716 journal editors, scientists and other members of the international publishing community was conducted as well as a literature search on sex and gender policies in scientific publishing. Results The Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines are a comprehensive procedure for reporting of sex and gender information in study design, data analyses, results and interpretation of findings. Conclusions The SAGER guidelines are designed primarily to guide authors in preparing their manuscripts, but they are also useful for editors, as gatekeepers of science, to integrate assessment of sex and gender into all manuscripts as an integral part of the editorial process.},

Methods: retrospective cohort that included a study group of 178 patients with SO and a control group of 181 patients with BMI 35-49.9Kg/m2. The groups were formed in a 1:1 nearest neighbor matching. The main variables were pre- and postoperative BMI and comorbidities, occurrence of severe postoperative complications, bowel obstruction, marginal ulcer, fistulae and 30-day death, besides the necessity of emergency room (ER) admission and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans in the postoperative period due to acute abdomen. Results: the study group comprised 74.0% of women while the control group had 56.7%. The mean follow-up time was similar between both groups (5.48 x 6.09 years, p=0.216). There was no statistically significant difference on the prevalence of hypertension and T2D between the groups according to the surgical technique. All deaths occurred in the Study group (BMI = 50kg/m2) who underwent RYGB. There was no difference between the groups regarding the occurrence of severe complications. Data on ER admissions and the need for abdominal CT to investigate postoperative abdominal pain did not show statistically significant difference between the groups. Conclusion: despite the high risk related to bariatric surgery in patients with SO, the benefits related to the remission of comorbidities are significant; although being lower than those found in patients with milder grades of obesity.},

Simultaneously, research in obesity treatment has advanced, and leaders in the field have issued complementary guidance. This article summarizes and synthesizes the 2013 ACC/AHA/TOS and the 2016 AACE/ACE guidelines and includes updates from more recent professional association guidance. Measurement of body mass index is recommended to initiate evaluation for overweight and obesity and determine disease classification. To stage disease severity, weight-related conditions should be assessed. Although lifestyle therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for this disease, both pharmacotherapy and metabolic and bariatric surgery produce greater and more sustained weight loss in treatment-approved populations as compared with lifestyle modifications alone. An ongoing partnership between the patient and clinician is highly recommended to manage this serious, progressive, chronic disease.},

abstract = {The Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) was first described by Harden in 1975 as an alternative to the existing methods of assessing clinical performance (Harden et al. 1975). The OSCE was designed to improve the validity and reliability of assessment of performance, which was previously assessed using the long case and short case examinations. Since then the use of the OSCE has become widespread within both undergraduate and postgraduate clinical education. We recognise that the introduction of the OSCE into an existing assessment programme is a challenging process requiring a considerable amount of theoretical and practical knowledge. The two parts of this Guide are designed to assist all those who intend implementing the OSCE into their assessment systems. Part I addresses the theoretical aspects of the OSCE, exploring its historical development, its place within the range of assessment tools and its core applications. Part II offers more practical information on the process of implementing an OSCE, including guidance on developing OSCE stations, choosing scoring rubrics, training examiners and standardised patients and managing quality assurance processes. Together we hope these two parts will act as a useful resource both for those choosing to implement the OSCE for the first time and also those wishing to quality assure their existing OSCE programme. {\textcopyright} 2013 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

abstract = {To avoid many of the disadvantages of the traditional clinical examination we have introduced the structured clinical examination. In this students rotate round a series of stations in the hospital ward. At one station they are asked to carry out a procedure, such as take a history, undertake one aspect of physical examination, or interpret laboratory investigations in the light of a patient's problem, and at the next station they have to answer questions on the findings at the previous station and their interpretation. As they cannot go back to check on omissions multiple-choice questions have a minimal cueing effect. The students may be observed and scored at some stations by examiners using a check list. In the structured clinical examination the variables and complexity of the examination are more easily controlled, its aims can be more clearly defined, and more ofthe student's knowledge can be tested. The examination is more objective and a marking strategy can be decided in advance. The examination results in improved feedback to students and staff. {\textcopyright} 1975, British Medical Journal Publishing Group. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The organisation, administration and running of a successful OSCE programme need considerable knowledge, experience and planning. Different teams looking after various aspects of OSCE need to work collaboratively for an effective question bank development, examiner training and standardised patients' training. Quality assurance is an ongoing process taking place throughout the OSCE cycle. In order for the OSCE to generate reliable results it is essential to pay attention to each and every element of quality assurance, as poorly standardised patients, untrained examiners, poor quality questions and inappropriate scoring rubrics each will affect the reliability of the OSCE. The validity will also be influenced if the questions are not realistic and mapped against the learning outcomes of the teaching programme.

abstract = {Context and Objective: Overall ratings (ORs) of competence, given by expert physicians, are incressingly used in clinical skills assessments. Nevertheless, the influence of specific components of competence on ORs is incompletely understood. The aim here was to investigate whether ORs for medical student history-taking competence are influence by performance relating to communication skills, completeness of questioning and asking content driven key questions. Design and Setting: Descriptive, quantitative, study at Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto, Universidade de S{\~{a}}o Paulo. Methods: Thi rty-six medical students were examined in a 15-station high-stake objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE), At four stations devoted to history-taking, examiners filled out checklists covering the components investigated and independently rated students overall performance using a five-point scale from 1(poor) to 5 (excellent). Physician ratings were aggregated for each student. Nonparametric correlations were made between ORs. Results: ORs presented significant correlations with checklist scores (Spearman's rs = 0.38; p = 0.02) and OSCE general results (rs = 0.52; p < 0.001]. Scores for "communications skills" tended to correlate with ORs (rs = 0.31), but without reaching significance (p = 0.06). Neither the scores for "completenes" (rs = 0.26; p = 0.11) nor those for "asking key questions" (rs = 0.07; p = 0.60) correlated with ORs. Conclusions: Experts' overall ratings for medical student competence regarding history-taking is likely to encompass o particular dimension, since ratings were only weekly influenced by specific compass of performance.

abstract = {Context: Assessment of clinical skills has a central role in medical education and the selection of suitable methods is highly relevant. The OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination) is now established as one of the most valid, reliable and effective tests for the assessment of clinical skills. Objectives: To describe student and faculty perceptions of an OSCE introduced in a traditional Brazilian medical school. Type of Study: Descriptive, semi-quantitative study. Setting: Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto, Universidade de S{\~{a}}o Paulo. Participants: 258 junior medical students finishing an introductory course on basic clinical skills and six faculty members deeply involved with the OSCE administration. Procedures: Over a period of three consecutive years, student perceptions on the examinations were evaluated using a structured questionnaire containing several five-point scalesl faculty members' opinions were collected using a structured questionnaire plus a personal interview. Main Measurements: Student satisfaction or dissatisfaction with aspects of OSCE administration and positive or negative opinions from faculty members. Results: Students were comfortable with cases and tasks, but nearly half (48%) of them criticized organizational aspects of the OSCE. Substantial proportions of students reported difficulties with both time management (70%) and stress control (70%). Improvement of several aspects of exams reduced criticism of organization to a minority (5%) of students, but the proportions of students reporting difficulties with time management (40%) and stress control (75%) during the exam remained virtually unchanged. Faculty members acknowledged the accuracy of the OSCE, but criticized its limitations for assessing the integrated approach to patients and complained that the examination was remarkably time and effort-consuming. The educational impact of the OSCE was felt to be limited, since other faculty members did not respond to the communication of exam results. Conclusions: In addition to shortage of resources and organizational difficulties, local cultural aspects and the absence of a more favorable educational climate may hinder lasting improvements in assessment methods in traditional medical schools.},

abstract = {Assessment of a doctor's or student's clinical competence is of key importance. The examiner should ask what competencies he is attempting to assess and how he can best assess them; whether, for example, by using an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), patient management problems (PMP), supervisors' reports, project work or assignments, or by auditing case records. He should consider the functions of the clinical examination, in particular its role in providing feedback to the student and teacher. With regard to timing there is a place for both in-course and end-of-course assessment of clinical competence. Finally, in considering who should undertake the assessment, the role of the student or doctor in assessing his own competence should not be overlooked. {\textcopyright} 1979 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

abstract = {Aim: A need was felt to improve the quality of admission and licensing procedures for international medical graduates in The Netherlands. Method: A clinical skills assessment was designed as part of a new procedure to realize a high-stakes, fair, transparent, and a time-limited path of admission for international medical graduates to the Dutch health care system. Additionally, it should provide a well-founded advice about length and content of additional medical training, should this be indicated by the outcome of the assessment. Results: The clinical skills assessment procedure was developed as a Dutch variant of the "Step 2 Clinical Skills examination" of the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) in collaboration with the United States National Board of Medical Examiners, which has a well-documented validity and reliability. The experience with the new procedure is yet limited, but enough to warrant a report. Discussion: Worldwide, a number of countries have developed such high-stake assessment procedures, but they show little uniformity and transparency. By describing the design and development of our procedure, we do not pretend to set a standard, but we hope to contribute to more fair, accurate and uniform approaches for doctors moving from one country to another. {\textcopyright} 2009 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose While academic accreditation bodies continue to promote competency-based medical education (CBME), the feasibility of conducting regular CBME assessments remains challenging. The purpose of this study was to identify evidence pertaining to the practical application of assessments that aim to measure technical competence for surgical trainees in a nonsimulated, operative setting. Method In August 2016, the authors systematically searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for English-language, peer-reviewed articles published in or after 1996. The title, abstract, and full text of identified articles were screened. Data regarding study characteristics, psychometric and measurement properties, implementation of assessment, competency definitions, and faculty training were extracted. The findings from the systematic review were supplemented by a scoping review to identify key strategies related to faculty uptake and implementation of CBME assessments. Results A total of 32 studies were included. The majority of studies reported reasonable scores of interrater reliability and internal consistency. Seven articles identified minimum scores required to establish competence. Twenty-five articles mentioned faculty training. Many of the faculty training interventions focused on timely completion of assessments or scale calibration. Conclusions There are a number of diverse tools used to assess competence for intraoperative technical skills and a lack of consensus regarding the definition of technical competence within and across surgical specialties. Further work is required to identify when and how often trainees should be assessed and to identify strategies to train faculty to ensure timely and accurate assessment.},

Results: UT estimates of BF% were better correlated with those of DEXA in both males and females (r = 0.98, SEE = 2.0) than with ADP (r = 0.94, SEE = 3.7) or BIA (r = 0.92, SEE = 4.4). The UT in both genders was better (TE = 1.0) than BIA (TE = 2.6) and ADP (TE = 3.0). The 95% limits of agreement were also better for the UT (-2%; 2%) than with BIA (-5.1%; 4.9%) and ADP (-6.3%; 5.3%). Conclusions: The limits of agreement with BIA and ADP are unacceptably high compared to a DEXA measure criterion. The use of a new portable device based on a UT produced a very accurate BF% estimate in relation to the DEXA reference technique. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 S. Karger AG.},

abstract = { Objective . To examine measurement of body composition by ultrasound compared with a reference technique:dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We evaluated the accuracy of a portable ultrasound-based device in estimating total body fat mass with those assessed by DXA in adult. Methods . Body fat mass has been estimated using a portable ultrasound-based device in comparison with a contemporary reference DXA apparatus: the Hologic Discovery A. Anthropometric data has been assessed in order to maximize the output of the software associated with the ultrasound-based device. A cross-validation between ultrasound technique (US) and DXA was developed in this study. Total body fat mass estimated by ultrasound was compared with this DXA model in a sample of 83 women and 41 men. Results . Ultrasound technique (US) of body fat (BF) was better correlated with DXA in both women (    r 2  = 0.97   ,   P < 0.01   ) and men (    r 2  = 0.92   ,   P < 0.01   ) with standard errors of estimates (SEE) being 2.1 kg and 2.2 kg, respectively. Conclusion . The use of a portable device based on a US produced a very accurate BF estimate in relation to DXA reference technique. As DXA absorptiometry techniques are not interchangeable, the use of our ultrasound-based device needs to be recalibrated on a more contemporary DXA. },

abstract = {Lower muscle mass in populations with obesity is associated obesity-related diseases like hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Bariatric surgery leads to sustained weight loss. During the weight reduction, loss of muscle should be minimized. Thus reliable quantification of muscle mass is much needed and therefore the also the need for validated methods. Imaging methods, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan, have been the gold standard for many years. However, these methods are costly and have limitations such as the maximum weight. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is currently the most used alternative. Other, less expensive methods are very limited in their validation in populations with morbid obesity.

abstract = {Background & aims: B-mode ultrasound accurately measures both muscle mass, body density and percent body fat (% BF) in younger adults, but how well it can estimate % BF in middle-aged and older adults using DXA-derived %BF as the criterion is unclear. We sought to develop % BF prediction equations for middle-aged and older adults using ultrasound subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT). Methods: A cross-sectional study of Japanese adults (n = 414, 50–79 years) where 276 subjects were randomly assigned to a model development group and the other 138 subjects were assigned to a cross-validation group. B-mode ultrasound measured SFT at nine sites. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measured % BF, arm fat mass (FM) and leg FM. Stepwise multiple linear regression developed prediction equations from anthropometric data (body mass, height, waist and hip circumference) and ultrasound SFT sites. Bland–Altman plots assessed validity of the prediction equations to measure % BF in the cross-validation group. Results: The best prediction equation for % BF was the following: [% BF = 15.709 + (1.753*anterior trunk SFT) + (5.626*Sex) + (3.635*posterior upper arm SFT) - (4.428*anterior lower leg SFT) – (0.170*height) + (0.264*waist) + (anterior thigh SFT*2.241); r2 = 0.809, standard error of the estimate (SEE) = 3.3 kg]. Arm FM and leg FM prediction equations had r2 values ranging from 0.690 to 0.812 and SEEs of 0.29 and 0.75 kg. A small mean bias was noted for estimating % BF (−0.14%), but large limits of agreement were found (−8.0–7.7%) and systematic error was noted in all of the equations (r = 0.275 to 0.515, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Despite high r2 values and a small mean bias found between predicted and DXA % BF, wide limits of agreement were found with some systematic error present. Therefore, these prediction equations for middle-aged and older adults may not be sufficiently accurate to use in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {Age-related decreases in muscle mass and function, known as sarcopenia, have been shown to be related to functional limitation, frailty, and an increase in morbidity and mortality. While the most accurate method to assess muscle mass is biopsy, this is impractical clinically. There are numerous methods to assess skeletal muscle mass including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) which are low cost and accessible. There are also more specific standards for assessing muscle mass or cross-sectional muscle area including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT). Each method has its own advantages and limitations in clinical practice. Other emerging methods include peripheral quantitative CT and ultrasound. The ideal test would be valid and reliable, low cost, and practical combined with simple measurements of isometric strength to define sarcopenia and predict future health events.},

abstract = {Ultrasound has been used effectively to assess body fat for nearly 5 decades, yet this method is not known as well as many other body composition techniques. The purpose of this review is to explain the technical principles of the ultrasound method, explain the procedures for taking a measurement and interpreting the results, evaluate the reliability and validity of this method for measuring subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, highlight the advantages and limitations of ultrasound relative to other body composition methods, consider its utility to clinical populations, and introduce new body composition-specific ultrasound technology. The focus of this review is adipose, although various tissue thicknesses (e.g., muscle and bone) can be measured with ultrasound. Being a portable imaging device that is capable of making fast regional estimates of body composition, ultrasound is an attractive assessment tool in instances when other methods are limited. Furthermore, much of the research suggests that it is reliable, reproducible, and accurate. The biggest limitations appear to be a lack of standardization for the measurement technique and results that are highly dependent on operator proficiency. New ultrasound devices and accompanying software designed specifically for the purpose of body composition assessment might help to minimize these limitations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Dale R. Wagner.},

abstract = {The first reports of accurate skeletal muscle mass measurement in human subjects appeared at about the same time as introduction of the sarcopenia concept in the late 1980s. Since then these methods, computed tomography and MRI, have been used to gain insights into older (i.e. anthropometry and urinary markers) and more recently developed and refined methods (ultrasound, bioimpedance analysis and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) of quantifying regional and total body skeletal muscle mass. The objective of this review is to describe the evolution of these methods and their continued development in the context of sarcopenia evaluation and treatment. Advances in these technologies are described with a focus on additional quantifiable measures that relate to muscle composition and 'quality'. The integration of these collective evaluations with strength and physical performance indices is highlighted with linkages to evaluation of sarcopenia and the spectrum of related disorders such as sarcopenic obesity, cachexia and frailty. Our findings show that currently available methods and those in development are capable of non-invasively extending measures from solely 'mass' to quality evaluations that promise to close the gaps now recognised between skeletal muscle mass and muscle function, morbidity and mortality. As the largest tissue compartment in most adults, skeletal muscle mass and aspects of muscle composition can now be evaluated by a wide array of technologies that provide important new research and clinical opportunities aligned with the growing interest in the spectrum of conditions associated with sarcopenia.},

While it is possible to monitor the BC and its variations at different levels, the tissue-organ composition studies have been proven to provide the most clinically applicable information. Ultrasonography (US), a fast, non-invasive, low-cost and widely available technique, holds great potential in the study of BC, as it can directly measure muscles, organs, visceral and subcutaneous fat tissue in different sections of the abdomen and body, overcoming some limits of anthropometric evaluation and other imaging techniques. Purpose of this review article is to explore the technical aspects and the applied methods of US examination to assess the potential clinical role of this technique in the context of BC characterization, investigating four pivotal topics [abdominal fat compartments, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), skeletal muscle, liver].},

Curcuma dose was 8 mg/animal/day. Histological and biochemical analyses were performed at the end of the experimental period. Results: Curcuma prevented weight gain, despite a higher food intake, and increased brown adipose tissue weight only in mice receiving standard diet. However, these changes were not observed in HFD + C group. The groups that received curcuma (SD + C and HFD + C) showed a pancreas with diffuse macro- and microgoticular steatosis. Conclusions: Curcuma supplementation did not prevent weight gain or improved glucose and lipid profile in mice receiving high-fat diet. Furthermore, there was evidence of possible curcuma toxicity in the pancreas of C57BL/6 mice. The implications of these findings on humans still need to be investigated.},

abstract = {Endothelial dysfunction is associated with several vascular conditions as atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus. In all these conditions insulin resistance (IR) is present. Cytokines are low molecular weight proteins with several endocrine and metabolic functions that participate of inflammation and immune response. Several of these cytokines are independent risk factors for cerebrovascular and coronary artery disease. The major sources of cytokines (adipokines) are the visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues. Thus, increased adipose tissue mass is associated with alteration in adipokine production as over expression of tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$, interleukin 6, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, and under expression of adiponectin in adipocite tissue. The pro-inflammatory status associated with these changes provides a potential link between IR and endothelial dysfunction, the early stage in the atherosclerotic process, in obese individuals, and type 2 diabetic patients. Reduction of adipose tissue mass through weight reduction in association with exercise reduces TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6, and PAI-1, increases adiponectin, and is associated with improved insulin sensitivity and endothelial function. This review will focus on the evidence for regulation of endothelial function by insulin and the adypokines such as adyponectin, leptin, resistin, IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$. Interaction between insulin signaling and adypokines will be discussed, as well as the concept that aberrant adypokine secretion in IR and/or obesity impairs endothelial function and contributes further to reduce insulin sensitivity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the inter-relation between high sensitivity C-reactive protein and glycated hemoglobin in prediction of risk of obstructive sleep apnea. METHODS: We included all individuals participating in a check-up program at the Preventive Medicine Center of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in 2014. The Berlin questionnaire for risk of obstructive sleep apnea was used, and the high sensitivity C-reactive protein and glycated hemoglobin levels were evaluated. RESULTS: The sample included 7,115 participants (age 43.4±9.6 years, 24.4% women). The Berlin questionnaire showed changes in 434 (6.1%) individuals. This finding was associated with high sensitivity C-reactive protein and glycated hemoglobin levels (p<0.001). However, only the association between the Berlin questionnaire result and glycated hemoglobin remained significant in the adjusted multivariate analysis, for the traditional risk factors and for an additional model, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. CONCLUSION: The glycated hemoglobin, even below the threshold for diagnosis of diabetes, is independently associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, even after adjustment for obesity and C-reactive protein. These findings suggest a possible pathophysiological link between changes in insulin resistance and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, independently from obesity or low-grade inflammation.

A altera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do question{\'{a}}rio de Berlin associou-se positivamente aos resultados da prote{\'{i}}na C-reativa de alta sensibilidade e da hemoglobina glicada (p<0,001). No entanto, apenas a associa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre o resultado do question{\'{a}}rio de Berlin e a hemoglobina glicada permaneceu significativa na an{\'{a}}lise multivariada ajustada tanto para fatores de risco tradicionais quanto para um modelo adicional, que incluiu tamb{\'{e}}m lipoprote{\'{i}}na de alta densidade-colesterol (HDL-c) e triglic{\'{e}}rides.

abstract = {Liver biopsy remains the gold standard in the assessment of severity of liver disease. Noninvasive tests have gained popularity to predict histology in view of the associated risks of biopsy. However, many models include tests not readily available, and mere are limited data from patients widi HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. We aimed to develop a model using routine tests to predict liver fibrosis in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. A retrospective analysis of liver histology was performed in 832 patients. Liver fibrosis was assessed via Ishak score; patients were categorized as 0-1, 2-3, or 4-6 and were randomly assigned to training (n = 555) or validation (n = 277) sets. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that platelet count (PLT), age, AST, and INR were significantly associated with fibrosis. Additional analysis revealed PLT, age, AST, and ALT as an alternative model Based on this, a simple index (FIB-4) was developed: age ([yr] × AST [U/L]) I ((PLT [109/L]) × (ALT [U/L])1/2). The AUROC of the index was 0.765 for differentiation between Ishak stage 0-3 and 4-6. At a cutoff of < 1.45 in the validation set, the negative predictive value to exclude advanced fibrosis (stage 4-6) was 90% with a sensitivity of 70%. A cutoff of > 3.25 had a positive predictive value of 65% and a specificity of 97%. Using these cutoffs, 87% of the 198 patients with FIB-4 values outside 1.45-3.25 would be correctly classified, and liver biopsy could be avoided in 71% of the validation group. In conclusion, noninvasive tests can accurately predict hepatic fibrosis and may reduce the need for liver biopsy in the majority of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients.

abstract = {Background: Nutritional status affects pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and can be monitored by using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). BIA measurements are commonly performed in the fasting state, which is burdensome for patients. We investigated whether fasting is necessary for clinical practice and research. Methods: Fat free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) were determined in adult CF patients (n = 84) by whole body single frequency BIA (Bodystat 500) in a fasting and non-fasting state. Fasting and non-fasting BIA outcomes were compared with Bland-Altman plots. Pulmonary function was expressed as Forced Expiratory Volume at 1 s percentage predicted (FEV1%pred). Comparability of the associations between fasting and non-fasting body composition measurements with FEV1%pred was assessed by multiple linear regression. Results: Fasting FFM, its index (FFMI), and phase angle were significantly lower than non-fasting estimates (−0.23 kg, p = 0.006, −0.07 kg/m2, p = 0.002, −0.10°, p = 0.000, respectively). Fasting FM and its index (FMI) were significantly higher than non-fasting estimates (0.22 kg, p = 0.008) 0.32%, p = 0.005, and 0.07 kg/m2, (p = 0.005). Differences between fasting and non-fasting FFM and FM were <1 kg in 86% of the patients. FFMI percentile estimates remained similar in 83% of the patients when measured after nutritional intake. Fasting and non-fasting FFMI showed similar associations with FEV1%pred ($\beta$: 4.3%, 95% CL: 0.98, 7.70 and $\beta$: 4.6%, 95% CI: 1.22, 8.00, respectively). Conclusion: Differences between fasting and non-fasting FFM and FM were not clinically relevant, and associations with pulmonary function remained similar. Therefore, BIA measurements can be performed in a non-fasting state.},

Prolonged aggression during the postpartum period could affect maternal care. Eclipta alba is traditionally known to induce neuropsychiatric alterations, however its ability to circumvent maternal aggression has not been elucidated. The present study was aimed to investigate the ability of the aqueous extract of Eclipta alba to suppress maternal aggression. In the single dose study, 100, 200 and 500mg/kg body weight of the aqueous extract of Eclipta alba was administered to parturient females 30 minutes prior to maternal aggression testing against intruder males. In the multiple dose study, 100, 200 and 500mg/kg of the extract were administered for 15 and 30 days and maternal aggression was quantified. Administration of the extract for 15 and 30 days in dose schedules of 200 and 500mg/kg body weight significantly suppressed agonistic encounters by the dams and therefore had beneficial anti-aggressive activity.},

The aim of this meta-analysis is to estimate mean phase-angle values in healthy individuals. Methods: This meta-analysis systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, SCIELO, LILACS, CINAHL, Web of Science and gray literature for studies estimating mean phase angles. Quality of evidence was assessed for all studies and subgroup (males and females) meta-analysis stratified by age group according to literature (up to 2; 3–5; 6–12; 13–15; 16–18; 19–28; 29–38; 39–48; 49–58; 59–69; 70–80 and >80 years of age) were conducted using random-effects models. Results: A total of 46 studies including 249,844 subjects were selected for the present analysis. Males show a pooled estimate of the mean phase angle of 3.6 (95% CI: 3.0–4.1) for infants (0–2 y), increasing progressively to 7.3 (95% CI: 7.0–7.5) at the teenage phase (16–18 y), stabilizing during adult ages (18–38) and decreasing progressively with ongoing years with an estimate of 5.3 (95% CI: 4.5–6.0) for elderly above 80 years old. Similarly, females start from 3.7 (95% CI: 3.2–4.3) for infants (0–2 y), increasing progressively to 6.4 (95% CI: 6.1–6.8) at the teenage phase (16–18 y), stabilizing during adult ages (18–48) and decreasing progressively with ongoing years with an estimate of 5.4 (95% CI: 5.3–5.6) for elderly above 80 years old. Also, males have higher estimates than females for all age groups except for infants (0–2) and subjects older than 80 years old. Heterogeneity was high for all age groups. Conclusions: In both sexes, phase-angle values have a similar pattern that start from infants, increase progressively up to the teenage phase, stabilize during adult ages, and then decrease progressively in older subjects and the elderly.},

abstract = {Phase angle is a composite measure that combines two raw bioelectrical impedance analysis measures: resistance and reactance. Phase angle has been considered an indicator of cellular health, integrity, and hydration. As inflammation and oxidative stress can damage cellular structures, phase angle has potential utility in early detecting inflammatory and oxidative status. Herein, we aimed to critically review the current understanding on the determinants of phase angle and its relationship with markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. We also discussed the potential role of phase angle in detecting chronic inflammation and related adverse outcomes. Several factors have been identified as predictors of phase angle, including age, sex, extracellular to intracellular water ratio, and fat-free mass. In addition to these factors, body mass index (BMI) also seems to influence phase angle. Available data also show that lower phase angle values are correlated (negligible to high correlation coefficients) with higher c-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 in studies involving the general and aging populations, as well as patients with chronic conditions. Although fewer studies have evaluated the relationship between phase angle and markers of oxidative stress, available data also suggest that phase angle has potential to be used as an indicator (for screening) of oxidative damage. Future studies including diverse populations and bioelectrical impedance devices are required to confirm the validity and accuracy of phase angle as a marker of inflammation and oxidative stress for clinical use.},

(Myrtaceae) is effective as an adjuvant to the treatment of patients with type-2DM. Fifteen patients were enrolled in a pilot, non-controlled study, and received E. punicifolia for 3months. After treatment, we observed a significant decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin, basal insulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, C-reactive protein, and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. There were no changes in fasting and postprandial glycemia. The compounds myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-Oxyloside, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside, phytol, gallic acid, and trans-caryophyllene present in the powdered dried leaves of E. punicifolia may be responsible for the therapeutic effect. In conclusion, the powdered leaves of E. punicifolia are promising as an adjuvant in the treatment of type-2 DM and deserve further investigation.},

In longitudinal studies, the mean of the difference of phase angles from the baseline was significantly higher for the active group than the control group (MD = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.49, P = 0.001), with low heterogeneity (I2 = 13%, P = 0.331). No evidence of publication bias was found and the overall risk of bias was moderate to high. Summary/conclusion: The positive association of physical activity with phase angle reinforces the importance of routinely including exercise in health care. We also identified the need for further studies to define with different types, intensities and frequencies of exercises should be conducted in order to find the best dose-effect relationship.},

abstract = {Objective: Obesity is characterized not only by an increase of fat mass but also by alterations in skeletal muscle. Bioimpedance analysis (BIA)-derived phase angle (PhA) may provide specific information on the inherent characteristics of fat-free mass, and is widely used as an index of poor nutritional status. The aim of this study was to describe whether and to what extent PhA varies depending on age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) in individuals with different weight status. Methods: We selected 1877 participants for this retrospective study (two weight status groups): 983 individuals with obesity (age 40 ± 13.9 y; BMI 39.5 ± 7.2 kg/m²) and 894 controls (age 40 ± 13.3 y; BMI 24.6 ± 2.7 kg/m²). Anthropometry and PhA at 50 kHz for the whole body were performed in all participants. Results: PhA was greater in men than in women, although a decline of PhA was observed with age, which was linear in women and occurred in men after 40 y of age. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed with increasing BMI in either sex; lower values might be observed when BMI >50 kg/m². Conclusions: A more detailed appraisal of BIA-derived PhA in obesity is reported in the present study, providing basic data that might be taken into consideration in prevention and clinical nutrition. Further studies are needed to explore differences of PhA in individuals with different weight status.},

The current study aimed to detect and evaluate lipidomic biomarkers for early detection of NAFLD as well as the potential efficiency of methanolic extract of Eclipta prostrata (E. prostrata) on disease management. In this study, Phytochemical screening of E. prostrata methanolic extract was performed using HPLC. NAFLD was induced in albino rats using a high-fat diet together with cholesterol and cholic acid. Comprehensive lipidomic analyses on sera from rats bearing NAFLD as well as normal healthy animals were carried out based on GC–MS and multivariate data analysis. The results showed that high doses (300&200 mg/kg.BW) of E. prostrata extract exhibited significant improvement in liver enzymes (ALT & AST) and lipid profile [total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerides (TAGs), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)] in rats bearing NAFLD. Glycerol, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid and cholest-5-en-3-ol (3$\beta$) acetate were detected as lipidomic biomarkers for early detection of NAFLD in rats' sera. Furthermore, E. prostrata extract showed a significant amelioration in the levels of these metabolic biomarkers in both protective and treated groups. These finding devoutly recommend using of lipidomic biomarkers for early detection of NAFLD and E. prostrata could be used as a protective agent as well as ameliorate this disease through its probable action on the fore-mentioned metabolites.},

abstract = {Introduction: Herbal medicines are an important part of healthcare worldwide. In Brazil, the national authorities issued the concept of “living pharmacies”, that produce and offer herbal medicines in the Brazilian unified public health system. Farm{\'{a}}cia da Natureza (Nature's Pharmacy) is a living pharmacy and a single, not-for-profit institution that integrates traditional and scientific knowledge on medicinal plants, along with the preservation of Brazilian biodiversity, with benefits to the health of the population that uses herbal drugs. A six-year experience of medical prescription of herbal medicines at Farm{\'{a}}cia da Natureza is reported Methods: A retrospective, descriptive analysis of data on medical prescriptions of herbal medicines was conducted (September 2013 to December 2019) retrieved from a computerized database. Results: A total of 47,418 prescription items for 4739 patients were analyzed. The most frequent pharmaceutical forms were tinctures (39.6%); capsules containing powdered plant material (20.7%); creams, ointments, or gels (12.3%); and aqueous extracts (11.7%). The five most frequently prescribed single-constituent herbal medicines were: Curcuma longa L. (Zingiberaceae); Valeriana officinalis L. (Caprifoliaceae); Aloysia polystachya (Griseb.) Moldenke (Verbenaceae); Eclipta prostrata (L.) L. (Asteraceae); and Baccharis trimera (Less.) DC. (Asteraceae). Nearly half of the plants were naturally occurring in Brazil, while more than 80% of the products were not present in Brazilian official documents. Conclusion: At Farm{\'{a}}cia da Natureza, herbal medicines are usually prescribed as tinctures and capsules containing powdered plant material, but other pharmaceutical forms are also prescribed. Half of the plants are of Brazilian origin and almost all preparations are galenic formulations.},

abstract = {Eclipta prostrata (Linn.) Linn. is a traditional Chinese medicine and has previously been reported to have hypolipidemic effects. However, its mechanism of action is not well understood. This study was conducted to identify the active fraction of Eclipta, its toxicity, its effect on hyperlipidemia, and its mechanism of action. The ethanol extract (EP) of Eclipta and fractions EPF1-EPF4, obtained by eluting with different concentrations of ethanol from a HPD-450 macroporous resin column chromatography of the EP, were screened in hyperlipidemic mice for lipid-lowering activity, and EPF3 was the most active fraction. The LD50 of EPF3 was undetectable because no mice died with administration of EPF3 at 10.4g/kg. Then, 48 male hamsters were used and randomly assigned to normal chow diet, high-fat diet, high-fat diet with Xuezhikang (positive control) or EPF3 (75, 150 and 250mg/kg) groups. We evaluated the effects of EPF3 on body weight gain, liver weight gain, serum lipid concentration, antioxidant enzyme activity, and the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in hyperlipidemic hamsters. The results showed that EPF3 significantly decreased body-weight gain and liver-weight gain and reduced the serum lipid levels in hyperlipidemic hamsters. EPF3 also increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes; up-regulated the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\alpha$ (PPAR$\alpha$), low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), lecithin-cholesterol transferase (LCAT) and scavenger receptor class B type Ι receptor (SR-BI); and down-regulated the mRNA expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) in the liver. These results indicate that EPF3 ameliorates hyperlipidemia, in part, by reducing oxidative stress and modulating the transcription of genes involved in lipid metabolism.},

@article{Yao2022,
abstract = {Background: Obesity is the cause of multiple metabolic disorders, and its incidence has been rapidly increasing worldwide. It develops when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure (EE). Wedelolactone (WDL) is a naturally isolated compound from Eclipta prostrata L. and possesses many pharmacological activities. However, little is known about the effect of WDL on obesity and EE. Purpose: The present study aimed to investigate the effect of WDL on obesity and EE in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and its underlying mechanism. Methods: Obese mice were induced by high fat diet. The effects of WDL on obese mice were assessed by examining body weight, fat mass, EE, glucose tolerance, and hepatic and kidney injury. 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into mature adipocytes and incubated with WDL in vitro. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time PCR were used to assess adipose browning. The inhibitory efficiency of WDL on nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) was evaluated using a fluorescence assay. Results: WDL reduced fat mass, suppressed body weight gain, and improved obesity-related metabolic disorders in DIO mice. WDL treatment promoted adipose browning and enhanced EE in both DIO mice and 3T3-L1 cells. These effects were eliminated in AMPK antagonized or PPAR$\alpha$ knockdown cells and in PPAR$\alpha$−/- mice. Furthermore, we identified the target of WDL to be NNMT, an appealing target for regulating energy metabolism. WDL inhibited NNMT with an extremely low IC50 of 0.03 µM. Inhibition of NNMT and activation of SIRT1/AMPK/PPAR$\alpha$ explains how WDL reverses obesity by prompting adipose browning. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the novel effects of WDL in promoting adipose browning, enhancing EE and attenuating obesity and uncover the underlying mechanism, which includes inhibition of NNMT and subsequently activation of SIRT1/AMPK/PPAR$\alpha$ in response to WDL. WDL could be further developed as a therapeutic agent for treating obesity and related metabolic diseases.},

abstract = {Phase angle (PhA), a noninvasive bioimpedance marker, is a useful tool for nutritional screening in several diseases. C-reactive protein (CRP), a strong risk factor for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, is a commonly used biomarker of meta-inflammation. As both PhA and CRP are influenced by age, BMI, and nutritional status, and exhibit a clear sex dimorphism, we examined the association between PhA and CRP levels in 1855 subjects (680 males and 1175 females), aged 18–59 years, with BMIs ranging from 19.5 to 69.4 kg/m2, stratified according to sex. PhA values and CRP levels were significantly lower in females than males (p < 0.001), while the adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) was lower in males compared to females (p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, physical activity, BMI, waist circumference, and adherence to the MD, PhA remained negatively associated with CRP levels in both genders (p < 0.001). In the ROC analysis, PhA ≤ 5.5 in males and ≤5.4 in females were the threshold values predicting increased hs-CRP levels. These results suggested that PhA might represent a valid predictor of CRP levels in both sexes regardless of body weight and adherence to the MD, which avoids the collection of blood sampling and expensive biochemical assays.},

abstract = {Background and aims: Very low-calorie ketogenic diets (VLCKDs) have recently gained increasing interest for their anti-inflammatory effects. Phase angle (PhA), a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived measure used as a screening tool to assess inflammatory status in various clinical conditions has recently been suggested as a novel predictor of inflammatory status in correlation with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. PhA's usefulness in monitoring inflammatory status changes in patients with obesity during active phase VLCKD has not yet been explored. The aim of this pilot study was to examine the role of PhA as a biomarker detecting early inflammatory status changes in women with overweight and obesity 1 month into the active stage of a VLCKD. Methods—Results: This uncontrolled, single-center, open-label pilot clinical study investigated 260 consecutively enrolled Caucasian women aged 18–69 years (BMI 25.0–50.9 kg/m2) after 31 days of an active stage VLCKD. Anthropometric measurements and PhA were assessed. hs-CRP levels were determined by nephelometric assay. Dietary compliance, physical activity recommendations, and ketosis status were tested weekly by telephone recall. At Day 31, BMI, WC, and hs-CRP levels were observed to have decreased (∆−7.3 ± 2.9%, ∆−6.3 ± 5.0%, and ∆−38.9 ± 45.6%; respectively), while PhA had increased (∆+8.6 ± 12.5%). Changes in ∆ hs-CRP were significantly correlated with changes in BMI, WC, and PhA (p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding variables, the correlation between changes in ∆ PhA and ∆ hs-CRP remained statistically significant, albeit attenuated (p = 0.024). Conclusion: This is the first study reporting how, along with the expected rapid effect on body weight, PhA changes during active stage VLKCD occurred very early on and independently of weight loss, and were negatively associated with hs-CRP levels. These findings further support the VLCKD as a first-line dietary intervention to obtain a rapid effect on the obesity-related inflammatory status. They also suggest the possible role of PhA as an easy diagnostic tool to detect inflammation, thereby avoiding blood sampling and expensive biochemical assays. It is also posited that changes in PhA could help nutritionists correctly plan the different stages of the VLCKD protocol.},

abstract = {Background/objectives: The phase angle, expressed through bioelectrical impedance, has been studied as a prognostic marker in several health conditions. As this issue is still conflicting, the question whether this parameter correlates with mortality in the most diverse clinical situations remains. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between phase angle and mortality through a systematic review of the literature. Subjects/methods: This research was conducted in electronic databases (Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, Lilacs, Scielo, e Scopus), and included studies that had phase angle as a variable of interest and mortality/survival as an outcome. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and disagreements were assessed by a third reviewer. Results: Forty-eight of 455 papers were assessed and an amount of 42 showed a correlation between phase angle and mortality. Conclusions: Phase angle seems to be a good indicator for mortality in many clinical situations and can be used in screening individuals prone to this outcome.},

abstract = {The liver is one of the most essential and largest organ for numerous biochemical reactions and metabolism in the human body. The major function of the liver is detoxification of toxic substances and the production of some important biomolecules. Liver injury or damage may result from chronic alcohol intake or Hepatitis, a genetic-induced metabolic disease. Many reasons are associated with liver damage, such as necrosis, fibrosis, increase in the lipid peroxidation of tissue and decrease in the glutathione level. Naturally occurring antioxidants are present in several components and are classified as secondary plant metabolites, e.g. polyphenols such as phenolic acids and flavonoids, and terpenoids such as carotenoids. Consumption of food products containing these compounds seems to play an important role in prophylaxis against various diseases. Available evidence indicates that the bioactive components derived from herbs have potential hepatoprotective agents. Herbal medicines have become more acceptable compared to synthetic drugs since 65% of patients in European countries depend on herbal remedies for the treatment and prevention of liver diseases. However, standardisation and pharmaco-vigilance concerning herbal products still lack evidence to substantiate their effective usage in liver disorders. This brief review has been framed systematically to collect maximum information of herbs, claiming the treatment of liver diseases, including their botanical names, traditional uses, and some of their detailed scientific evidence in various journals. The current literature study may be helpful in the formulation of novel herbal medicines to treat hepatic disorders.},

@article{Hassapidou2023,
abstract = {Introduction: Obesity affects nearly 1 in 4 European adults increasing their risk for mortality and physical and psychological morbidity. Obesity is a chronic relapsing disease characterized by abnormal or excessive adiposity with risks to health. Medical nutrition therapy based on the latest scientific evidence should be offered to all Europeans living with obesity as part of obesity treatment interventions. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify the latest evidence published in the November 2018-March 2021 period and to synthesize them in the European guidelines for medical nutrition therapy in adult obesity. Results: Medical nutrition therapy should be administered by trained dietitians as part of a multidisciplinary team and should aim to achieve positive health outcomes, not solely weight changes. A diverse range of nutrition interventions are shown to be effective in the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities, and dietitians should consider all options and deliver personalized interventions. Although caloric restriction-based interventions are effective in promoting weight reduction, long-term adherence to behavioural changes may be better supported via alternative interventions based on eating patterns, food quality, and mindfulness. The Mediterranean diet, vegetarian diets, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, portfolio diet, Nordic, and low-carbohydrate diets have all been associated with improvement in metabolic health with or without changes in body weight. In the November 2018-March 2021 period, the latest evidence published focused around intermittent fasting and meal replacements as obesity treatment options. Although the role of meal replacements is further strengthened by the new evidence, for intermittent fasting no evidence of significant advantage over and above continuous energy restriction was found. Pulses, fruit and vegetables, nuts, whole grains, and dairy foods are also important elements in the medical nutrition therapy of adult obesity. Discussion: Any nutrition intervention should be based on a detailed nutritional assessment including an assessment of personal values, preferences, and social determinants of eating habits. Dietitians are expected to design interventions that are flexible and person centred. Approaches that avoid caloric restriction or detailed eating plans (non-dieting approaches) are also recommended for improvement of quality of life and body image perceptions.},

abstract = {Background When activated by the sympathetic nervous system, brown adipose tissue (BAT) increases energy expenditure to produce heat. Augmenting BAT mass or increasing BAT activation could potentially be used to decrease obesity. Noninvasive methods to detect and monitor BAT mass are needed. Contrast ultrasound can estimate BAT blood flow and is able to measure the perfused volume of an organ and thus its mass. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether contrast ultrasound could characterize BAT mass in two mouse models of obesity: wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet and mutant db/db mice. Methods Contrast ultrasound of BAT (Definity 2 $\mu$L/min; 14-MHz linear probe) was performed before and after stimulation of BAT with norepinephrine (NE). BAT replenishment curves were obtained, and blood flow was estimated by the product of the curve's plateau and slope. Additionally, consecutive two-dimensional images of perfused BAT were acquired at 1-mm intervals after stimulation with NE and used to assess BAT volume and mass. Results BAT blood flow increased after NE infusion in all mice studied. Blood flow response to NE was similar in wild-type mice fed either a low-fat diet or a high-fat diet. BAT blood flow was lower in db/db mice than in wild-type mice (P =.02). Contrast ultrasound-derived BAT mass was correlated with BAT mass obtained at necropsy (R2 = 0.83, P <.001). BAT mass was higher in mice fed a high-fat diet than in those fed a low-fat diet. Conclusions Contrast ultrasound can be used to estimate BAT mass in mice when BAT vascularization is not significantly impaired. This noninvasive technique may potentially allow the serial evaluation of therapies designed to augment BAT mass. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American Society of Echocardiography.},

abstract = {Rationale: To compare Phase Angle reference values (PhARV) from four population samples and to understand how population of origin, type of bioimpedance analysis (BIA) instrument, body mass index (BMI), sex and age can explain PhA variability. Methods: A sample was obtained by assembling four national databases containing PhARV from Brazil, Germany, Switzerland and the United States. Different BIA systems were used and the evaluations were performed under standardized procedures. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify the significant PhA determinants. Results: The pooled sample has 282,807 subjects, 69% female, mean (SD) age of 43.5 (12.6) years. Although several BIA devices were used, the PhARV have a similar distribution among the four countries: males have higher values than females for the same age group until 7th decade (p < 0.05) and values are lower with greater age from 4th decade (p < 0.05). Different PhARV were obtained from each population group, according to sex and age decade (p < 0.05). Sex and age explain most of the PhA variability (AdjR2 = 0.34) in the regression analysis. Age has a negative effect in PhA: each decade decreases from 0.21° to 0.88° from 5th decade. BMI <18.5 and >40 kg/m2 are associated with a decrease of 0.36° and 0.02°, respectively, in PhA values. African Americans have PhA values 0.84° higher than the other race groups. The BIA device is still a significant factor in determining PhA variability even after controlling for all of these biological variables. Compared to the RJL device, BIA 2000-S results in PhA values 0.38° smaller. Conclusion: PhARV has a similar distribution across sex and age among different populations, but reference values are quite different and it is not possible to use a “global” PhARV. The selected BIA device has a significant impact on measured PhA and is a likely cause of the between-population differences.},

abstract = {Studies have suggested that obesity prevalence varies by income and educational level, although patterns might differ between high-income and low-income countries (1-3). Previous analyses of U.S. data have shown that the prevalence of obesity varied by income and education, but results were not consistent by sex and race/Hispanic origin (4). Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), CDC analyzed obesity prevalence among adults (aged ≥20 years) by three levels of household income, based on percentage (≤130%, >130% to ≤350%, and >350%) of the federal poverty level (FPL) and individual education level (high school graduate or less, some college, and college graduate). During 2011-2014, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among adults was lower in the highest income group (31.2%) than the other groups (40.8% [>130% to ≤350%] and 39.0% [≤130%]). The age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among college graduates was lower (27.8%) than among those with some college (40.6%) and those who were high school graduates or less (40.0%). The patterns were not consistent across all sex and racial/Hispanic origin subgroups. Continued progress is needed to achieve the Healthy People 2020 targets of reducing age-adjusted obesity prevalence to <30.5% and reducing disparities (5).},

abstract = {Carl Wernicke described the disease bearing his name in 1881 and reported three cases characterized by the presence of mental confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. Wernicke's disease is mainly observed in alcoholic patients, due to decreased vitamin intake as a consequence of an unbalanced diet, and a reduction of absorption due to the effects of alcohol. Likewise, inadequate vitamin intake is prevalent in older patients. Wernicke's encephalopathy due to inappropriate total parenteral nutrition (TPN) occurs infrequently; recently, there is an increase in the literature concerning Wernicke's encephalopathy in patients after general and bariatric surgeries. We present two cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy after oncologic gastrointestinal surgery by failure to administer vitamin B1 during TPN; to our knowledge, these are the first two cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy after colorectal surgery for cancer. In our opinion, timely diagnosis and treatment are mandatory to avoid nonfunctional recovery and consequent malpractice legal actions as well as an increase in the health-care costs correlated with the prolonged hospital stay and with the nonfunctional recovery.},

MATERIAL E M{\'{E}}TODO: Foram estudadas 1.035 pessoas com idade entre 20 e 69 anos, residentes na zona urbana do munic{\'{i}}pio. A obesidade foi definida a partir do {\'{i}}ndice de massa corporal (IMC) igual ou superior a 30 kg/m². A an{\'{a}}lise multivariada foi realizada considerando um modelo hier{\'{a}}rquico das vari{\'{a}}veis associadas com obesidade em ambos os sexos. RESULTADOS: A preval{\^{e}}ncia de obesidade foi de 21% (IC95% 18 - 23), sendo de 25% (IC95% 22 - 29) entre as mulheres e 15% (IC95% 12 - 18) entre os homens. A rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre as vari{\'{a}}veis socioecon{\^{o}}micas e a obesidade foi inversa entre as mulheres e direta entre os homens. Entre as mulheres, as vari{\'{a}}veis que se mantiveram associadas significativamente com obesidade foram: obesidade dos pais, ocorr{\^{e}}ncia de diabete ou hipertens{\~{a}}o, n{\~{a}}o fumar, menor n{\'{u}}mero de refei{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es di{\'{a}}rias e n{\~{a}}o ter realizado exerc{\'{i}}cio f{\'{i}}sico no lazer durante o {\'{u}}ltimo ano. Para os homens somente a ocorr{\^{e}}ncia de obesidade nos pais e a hipertens{\~{a}}o arterial sist{\^{e}}mica estiveram significativamente associadas, enquanto a prote{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do maior n{\'{u}}mero de refei{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es apresentou uma associa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o quase significativa (p = 0,07). CONCLUS{\~{A}}O: Os resultados indicam que os determinantes de obesidade s{\~{a}}o diferentes entre os sexos, ocorrendo em maior freq{\"{u}}{\^{e}}ncia entre as mulheres e com o aumento da idade.},

In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 60 women with NAFLD were selected and randomly assigned into 2 groups to take 1,000 mg/day powder of licorice root extract or placebo for 12 weeks. In addition, all the patients were advised to follow a weight loss diet and healthy lifestyle. The plasma levels of liver enzymes, glycemic indices, lipid profile, oxidative stress parameters, as well as hepatic steatosis were measured at the beginning and end of the study. Through the 12-weeks period of supplementation, women who received powder of licorice root experienced a statistically significant improvement in alanine aminotransferase (p <.001), insulin (p =.002), insulin resistance (p =.003), malondialdehyde (p <.001) serum levels, and ultrasonographic findings of liver steatosis (p <.001), compared to the placebo group. In conclusion, licorice root supplementation in addition to gradual weight loss and lifestyle modification is superior to lifestyle modification alone for the treatment of NAFLD.},

abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis in the absence of a history of significant alcohol use or other known liver disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the progressive form of NAFLD. The Pathology Committee of the NASH Clinical Research Network designed and validated a histological feature scoring system that addresses the full spectrum of lesions of NAFLD and proposed a NAFLD activity score (NAS) for use in clinical trials. The scoring system comprised 14 histological features, 4 of which were evaluated semi-quantitatively: steatosis (0-3), lobular inflammation (0-2), hepatocellular ballooning (0-2), and fibrosis (0-4). Another nine features were recorded as present or absent. An anonymized study set of 50 cases (32 from adult hepatology services, 18 from pediatric hepatology services) was assembled, coded, and circulated. For the validation study, agreement on scoring and a diagnostic categorization ("NASH," "borderline," or "not NASH") were evaluated by using weighted kappa statistics. Inter-rater agreement on adult cases was: 0.84 for fibrosis, 0.79 for steatosis, 0.56 for injury, and 0.45 for lobular inflammation. Agreement on diagnostic category was 0.61. Using multiple logistic regression, five features were independently associated with the diagnosis of NASH in adult biopsies: steatosis (P = .009), hepatocellular ballooning (P = .0001), lobular inflammation (P = .0001), fibrosis (P = .0001), and the absence of lipogranulomas (P = .001). The proposed NAS is the unweighted sum of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning scores. In conclusion, we present a strong scoring system and NAS for NAFLD and NASH with reasonable inter-rater reproducibility that should be useful for studies of both adults and children with any degree of NAFLD. NAS of ≥5 correlated with a diagnosis of NASH, and biopsies with scores of less than 3 were diagnosed as "not NASH."

abstract = {Introduction: Phase angle (PhA) is a ratio of reactance and resistance {arctangent (reactance (Xc)/resistance (R)) × (180°/$\pi$)}, which can be obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). PhA indicates cellular health and integrity, and it is also considered as a prognostic tool in medical disorders and an indicator of nutritional status (especially of muscle quality) in patients with obesity. However, PhA has limited usefulness in clinical practice because of a lackness of reference values for Chinese overweight and obese populations. The main aim of this study was to show PhA reference data in different age and BMI groups by sex. In addition, we also study the association of age, sex, and BMI on PhA. Methods: A total of 1729 overweight and obese participants were included in this study. PhA and body composition were measured using segmental multifrequency BIA. Differences in mean values for variables were tested by one-way analysis of variance. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the associations of PhA with age, sex and BMI. Results: Multiple regression analysis showed that age, sex and BMI were significant (P < 0.05) independent influence factors of PhA in Chinese overweight and obese adults when age and BMI were continues variables. The mean PhA value for all participants was 5.5°. Mean BMI, age, weight, height and 50kHz-PhA were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in male participants than female ones. In age groups and BMI groups, mean 50kHz-PhA was significantly higher (P < 0.005) in male participants than female ones. When age groups and BMI groups were categorical variables, multiple regression analysis showed that different age groups (46–55 years and ≥ 56 years) had a significantly lower (P < 0.005) PhA as compared with the baseline group (18-25 years) and different BMI groups (≥ 28 kg/m2) had a significantly higher (P < 0.05) PhA as compared with the baseline group (24–27.9 kg/m2). Conclusion: PhA differed according to age, sex and BMI. Reference data in this study can be taken into consideration when deriving the reference values for overweight and obese Chinese populations.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) thickness and rectus femoris (RF) muscle thickness on RF and vastus intermedius (VI) echo intensity using human cadavers. Methods: The echo intensity of the RF and VI was measured in 11 legs of seven cadavers under three conditions: intact condition (Model 1), SCAT removed (Model 2), and SCAT and RF removed (Model 3). Results: RF echo intensity in Model 1 (69.2 ± 20.3 a.u.) was significantly lower than that in Model 2 (83.4 ± 15.9 a.u.) (P = 0.003). VI echo intensity in Models 1 to 3 showed similar results to RF echo intensity (P = 0.003 to 0.001). Regarding the relationship between VI echo intensity and VI muscle thickness, the regression lines shifted upward in a parallel fashion in the order Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the variation in RF echo intensity was explained by RF muscle thickness (P = 0.036) and SCAT thickness (P = 0.001), while the variation in VI echo intensity was explained by RF muscle thickness (P = 0.035). Conclusion: These results suggest that SCAT thickness and RF muscle thickness induce lower RF echo intensity, while RF muscle thickness induces lower VI echo intensity.},

This study was aimed at determining the intra- and inter-examiner reliability for marking points to measure adipose tissue and muscle thickness and assessing it in terms of the performance and evaluation of the corresponding ultrasound scans. Subjects/Methods: Intra- and inter-examiner reliability was tested in 120 patients. Limb lengths were measured to mark three and two measuring points on both the thighs and upper arms, respectively. Ultrasound scans were performed at each measuring point to evaluate muscle and adipose tissue thickness. Results: Regarding the marking of the measuring points, intra- and inter-examiner reliability were high to very high, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.74 to 0.96. In the performance and evaluation of adipose tissue thickness, all measuring points showed a high to very high reliability, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.70 to 0.97. In the performance and evaluation of muscle thickness, the ventral measuring point on the thigh and the anterior measuring point on the upper arm showed the best reliability, with high to very high correlation coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.93. Conclusions: In terms of intra- and inter-examiner reliability, the ventral measuring point on the thigh and the anterior measuring point on the upper arm can be strongly recommended for ultrasound measurements of muscle and adipose tissue thickness.},

abstract = {Introduction: There is a large variety of body fat (BF) measurements, which differ in validity and reliability. The aim of this study was to measure subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) using ultrasound (US) in highly trained junior rowers in a field setting, establish fat patterning profiles, and compare the profiles between male and female athletes. Skinfold thickness (SKF) measurements were also taken and compared to US measurements. Methods: Sixteen athletes participated. US measurements were taken at eight sites and reported as a sum of SAT (D): DExcl (without embedded structures) and DIncl (including embedded structures). SKF was measured at three sites and reported as a sum of adipose tissue thickness (SUMSKF). Results: Mean SAT thickness (DIncl) was 27.6 ± 12.4 mm for males and 65.5 ± 11.8 mm for females. Females had significantly more embedded structures than males (P =.016). Significant correlations were found (P <.001, r = 0.92) comparing SUMSKF to DIncl and between SKF and US measurements at the thigh site (P <.001, r = 0.86). Conclusion: US is a suitable tool to measure BF in the field testing of athletes and enables measurements of SAT with an accuracy and reliability not reached before. The sum of thicknesses (DIncl or DExcl) can be used to represent subcutaneous fat based on accurate measurements of uncompressed SAT thicknesses.},

abstract = {Summary: When health professionals measure the fitness levels of clients, body composition is usually estimated. In field settings, body composition is commonly estimated with skinfolds or bioelectrical impedance analysis. Recently, a portable ultrasound device has been manufactured to estimate what percentage of body mass is composed of adipose tissue (AT%). A reported advantage of using ultrasound is that inter- and intrarater variations may be minimized when compared with the skinfold technique. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was twofold; 1) to determine the validity of a portable ultrasound device compared with skinfolds and 2) determine the reliability of the portable ultrasound device. Participants had their measurements taken in the following order: urine specific gravity, body mass, height, skinfolds and ultrasound determined. Participants had their urine specific gravity and ultrasound determined AT% estimates measured again 48 h later. The current pilot study found that the ultrasound was not a valid estimate of AT% when compared with the skinfold estimate (TE > 4%). In addition, the 1-site estimate from the ultrasound was more reliable than the 3-site estimate of AT%. These data are of importance to practitioners because it demonstrates that while the ultrasound is not a valid estimate compared with skinfolds, the 1-site estimate may be able to track changes in AT% over time, making the ultrasound an option for assessing changes in body composition. {\textcopyright} 2013 Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine.

abstract = {Introduction/Aims: Attenuation of the ultrasound (US) wave is a serious limitation of echo intensity (EI) on B-mode US. The aim of this study was to determine whether the focus depth of US images influences the depth-dependent attenuation of EI and the relationship between EI and intramuscular adipose tissues (IntraMAT). Methods: The rectus femoris (RF) and vastus intermedius (VI) of the right thigh were studied in 135 adults (92 older, 43 younger). The EI on US images was measured at three focus depth conditions: top of the image, center of the RF, and center of the VI. The depth of the region of interest (ROI) was measured. IntraMAT was calculated using water and fat images based on the two-point Dixon technique with a 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Results: The correlation between EI and IntraMAT was stronger in the focus RF and VI conditions than in the focus top condition and stronger for RF than for VI. The depth of the ROI influenced the IntraMAT-adjusted residual EI more in the focus top condition than in the focus RF and VI conditions, and influenced VI more strongly than it did RF. Discussion: By mitigating EI attenuation, EI with a focus depth adjusted to the ROI reflected IntraMAT more accurately than that without adjustment. However, it may not completely prevent the potential influence of depth-dependent attenuation of EI, especially for deeper muscles such as the VI.},

abstract = {Background: A procedure to measure subcutaneous adipose (SAT) using brightness-mode ultrasound has recently been standardized and applied to various groups of adults including underweight, overweight and obese adults. High reliability of this procedure was found in each of the examined groups. The purpose of this study was to determine inter-observer reliability of the standardized brightness-mode ultrasound measurement of uncompressed SAT in three to six-year-old children. Methods: Three experienced observers independently captured the ultrasound images at the eight standardized measurement sites in each of the 20 children and evaluated their images using an interactive software that detects the SAT contour and automatically measures multiple thicknesses in each image; the mean of these represents SAT thickness at a given site. The children were aged 4.9 ± 1.0 years; their body mass index ranged from 13.6-17.7 kgm- 2. Sound speed was set to 1450 ms- 1 for SAT. Results: SAT thickness sums with fibrous structures included (D I) ranged from 25.7-86.4 mm, mean D I was 48.1 ± 15.5 mm. For D I, resulting from 160 measurements by each observer, the intra-class correlation coefficient was 0.998 (95% confidence interval 0.980-0.999), standard error of the estimate was 1.1 mm, and 95% limits of agreement were within ±2.1 mm. The median difference in D I was 0.8 mm, i.e. about 1.9% of mean D I. Conclusions: Inter-observer results in children are comparable to previously described high reliability in adults. This method, which provides a technical thickness measurement accuracy of about 0.1 to 0.2 mm, enables monitoring of subcutaneous adipose tissue in children with a similarly high reliability as was obtained in adults previously.

Design: Thirty active females (27 ± 5 y) with regularly occurring menstrual cycles participated in a cross sectional study. Methods: Participants completed four assessment sessions scheduled according to each individual's menstrual cycle. These sessions took place during their (1) early follicular, (2) mid-to-late follicular, (3) mid-luteal and (4) second early follicular phases. Body composition estimates were acquired using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness was measured at eight sites using standardised brightness-mode ultrasound and skinfolds. Results: The sum of eight subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness measured using standardised brightness-mode ultrasound and skinfolds were not different between the cycle phases (p > 0.05). Body mass and Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry total mass estimate as well as Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry estimates of total and regional lean and fat mass were also not different between cycle phases (p > 0.05) and any changes were within the 95% confidence intervals of their respective least significant change values. Conclusions: There were no true and meaningful changes in the sum of eight subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness measured via standardised brightness-mode ultrasound and skinfolds or Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry total and regional tissue mass estimates across the menstrual cycle in active eumenorrheic females. Body composition may thus be assessed via these methods in this population at any cycle phase with standardised participant presentation.},

abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the impact of acute food and fluid intake or hydration status on the standardised brightness-mode ultrasound measurement of subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness. Design: Thirty active adults (female n = 10) participated in a randomised cross over study. Methods: Participants completed three body composition assessment sessions via standardised brightness-mode ultrasound and Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Participants were assessed under standardised presentation during ‘food only' and ‘food plus water' sessions at baseline and reassessed after their allotted intake. ‘Hypohydration plus water' was undertaken in a hypohydrated state at baseline and reassessed after water intake. Results: The sum of eight subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness was lower when measured after ‘food only' or ‘food plus water' compared to baseline (−0.1 to −0.9 mm; p < 0.01). However, these changes were less than the 95% confidence interval of the technical error of measurement of the investigator. Body mass, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry total and trunk mass, lean mass and trunk lean mass estimates increased (p < 0.01) following ‘food only' or ‘food plus water', and decreased with hypohydration (p < 0.01). Total and regional fat mass estimates were not impacted. Conclusions: The sum of eight subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness measured via standardised brightness-mode ultrasound was unaffected by acute food and fluid consumption or hydration status changes. Comparatively, these interventions altered dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry body composition estimates, especially that of lean mass components. Standardised brightness-mode ultrasound can therefore be used to monitor changes in fat patterning when standardised client presentation is not practically achievable.},

The goal is to provide an illustrated step-by-step guide of the ultrasound method developed since 2011, refined and applied during the USVALID study. Methods: We use 2 linear probes with a footprint width of 25,6 and 38,4 mm. The subject is lying relaxed with the head of bed elevated to 30°. Foam supports are placed under elbows and knees. Precise anatomical landmarks are palpated to measure the limb lengths. 3 measuring points at 50% of the thigh length and 2 measuring points at 70% of the upper arm length are marked on both sides. A gelpad is used to enable minimal compression. It is verified that the borders of the scan are blurred. Each measuring point is scanned in the short-axis and long-axis plane to more easily determine the subcutaneous adipose tissue and muscle structures especially in the presence of edema. First the quality of the scan is evaluated according to the visibility of the muscle fascia and bone surface. Then subcutaneous adipose tissue and entire muscle thickness are measured at the exact center of the scan drawing the shortest possible line from skin to bone surface. Discussion: The illustrated description of the USVALID ultrasound method enables reproducibility by other researchers for external validity. The subject's position, the location of the measuring points, the performance and evaluation of the ultrasound scans are discussed and compared to other published ultrasound methodologies.},

abstract = {Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) measurements with ultrasound have recently been introduced to assess body fat in elite athletes. However, appropriate protocols and data on various groups of athletes are missing. We investigated intra-rater reliability of SAT measurements using ultrasound in elite canoe athletes. 25 international level canoeists (18 male, 7 female; 23±4 years; 81±11 kg; 1.83±0.09 m; 20±3 training h/wk) were measured on 2 consecutive days. SAT was assessed with B-mode ultrasound at 8 sites (ISAK): triceps, subscapular, biceps, iliac crest, supraspinal, abdominal, front thigh, medial calf, and quantified using image analysis software. Data was analyzed descriptively (mean±SD, [range]). Coefficient of variation (CV%), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC, 2.1) and absolute (LoA) and ratio limits of agreement (RLoA) were calculated for day-to-day reliability. Mean sum of SAT thickness was 30.0±19.4 mm [8.0, 80.1 mm], with 3.9±1.8 mm [1.2 mm subscapular, 8.0 mm abdominal] for individual sites. CV for the sum of sites was 4.7%, ICC 0.99, LoA 1.7±3.6 mm, RLoA 0.940 ( *  /÷1.155). Measuring SAT with ultrasound has proved to have excellent day-to-day reliability in elite canoe athletes. Recommendations for standardization of the method will further increase accuracy and reproducibility.},

abstract = {Background and objectives: Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is an emerging problem, especially in candidates for bariatric surgery (BS). We hypothesized that musculoskeletal ultrasound (MUS), a simple and accessible method, could be a reliable index of SO. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional pilot study including 122 subjects (90 cases and 32 controls, 73% female, mean age: 51.2 years) who underwent BS was conducted at University Hospital M{\'{u}}tua Terrassa. The lean mass (LM) was calculated by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and the thigh muscle thickness (TMT) by MUS. To identify the subjects with SO by BIA, we used skeletal muscle index (SMI). The validity of MUS was determined using the ROC curve. Results: The mean BMI in the obesity group was 44.22 kg/m2. We observed a correlation between the LM and SMI assessed by BIA and the TMT assessed by MUS (R = 0.46, p < 0.001). This correlation was maintained at significant levels in the SO group (n = 40): R = 0.79; p = 0.003). The TMT assessed by MUS was able to predict SMI using BIA (AUC 0.77; 95% CI: 0.68242 to 0.84281). The optimal cut-off point for maximum efficiency was 1.57 cm in TMT (sensitivity = 75.6% and specificity = 71.1%). Conclusions: The TMT of the quadriceps assessed by US is a useful tool for identifying subjects with SO. Larger studies to validate this simple low-cost screening strategy are warranted.},

abstract = {Introduction: Ultrasound (US) B-mode technique, an accurate and reliable method for analysing uncompressed subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), has been published recently [1,3,4]. This method can be applied to all athletes and is of particular importance in weightsensitive sports [3-5]. Method(s):Wecompared SAT sums from eight standardised sites between 11 Kenyan,male, endurance runners (G1: age 28.7 +/- 5.95 y, body height 1.677 +/- 0.05 m, body weight 55.1 +/- 5.21 kg, and BMI 19.6 +/- 1.73 kg m -2) and 10 Austrian, male, orienteering runners (G2: age 21.8 +/- 3.97 y, body height 1.813 +/- 0.06 m, body weight 69.1 +/- 6.4 kg, and BMI 21.0 +/- 1.73 kg m -2). For the standardised US approach, the following eight sites were used: upper and lower abdomen, erector spinae, distal triceps, brachioradialis, lateral and front thigh and medial calf. Fat compression was avoided. The software (USTissue-Fat-Scientific, rotosport.com) enabled semi-automatic thickness measurements and for distinguishing between fat and fibrous structures (accuracy: about 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mm at 18, 9 and 5 MHz, respectively). Mann-Whitney U-test was used. Result(s): There was a significant difference (p<0.05) between the SAT sums (DI) in G1 (DI,MEAN: 11.4 mm +/- 10.17, DI,MIN: 2.7mm and DI,MAX: 36.2 mm) and Austrian orienteering athletes'G2(DI,MEAN: 19.1 mm +/- 7.17, DI,MIN: 5.0mm and DI,MAX: 26.6 mm). Eight athletes had extremely low SAT sums, seven athletes had very low SAT sums, five athletes had low SAT values [1], and just one athlete had noticeable ballast weight. Conclusion(s): US enables to distinguish SAT between athlete groups in weight-sensitive sports. This methodfulfils the requested accuracy and reliability for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies [2,3,4] and can be used advantageously for medical diagnosis and for performance optimisation strategies.},

abstract = {Objectives Sarcopenia is relatively common in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Thicknesses of the quadriceps muscle and fat are easily measured by ultrasound (US) and are known to be related to skeletal muscle mass and fat mass, respectively. Methods Eighty-four patients enrolled in the prospective correlation research of sarcopenia, skeletal muscle, and disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis study (UMIN000023744) underwent US examinations of anterior thigh muscle thickness (MT) and fat thickness (FT). Muscle and body fat (BF) mass were also examined by a body composition analyzer. Whether MT and FT were related to sarcopenia and obesity was examined. Results MT was significantly lower in RA patients with sarcopenia than in those without (23.8 vs 28.2 mm, P = 0.001). MT was related to sarcopenia (men: r = 0.56, P = 0.02, women: r = 0.32, P = 0.01). The cut-off value of MT for sarcopenia was 24.7 mm in men and 19.7 mm in women on receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. FT was correlated with BF percentage (%BF; men: r = 0.66, P < 0.01, women: r = 0.62, P < 0.001), which was estimated by 2.04xFT+8.53 in men and 1.2xFT+17.42 in women by a simple linear regression model. This means that FT ≥ 8.1 mm in men and FT ≥ 14.6 mm in women indicated obesity. Conclusions US examination of the anterior thigh was useful to detect sarcopenia and obesity in RA patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Sarcopenic obesity (SO) marks a confluence of 2 complex  entities involving the muscle-liver-adipose tissue axis. Computed tomographic (CT) scan-derived skeletal muscle index (SMI) remains the gold standard for sarcopenia assessment in SO. However, it has intrinsic limitations of cost, radiation, and point of care applicability. We assessed the role of muscle ultrasound (US) in SO. METHODS: A total of 52 patients with cirrhosis and obesity were assessed for sarcopenia using SMI. US assessment of thigh and forearm muscles was done to record quadriceps muscle thickness (QMT), quadriceps feather index (QMFI), forearm muscle thickness (FMT), and forearm feather index (FFI), respectively. Evaluated US parameters were correlated with SMI and assessed for diagnostic accuracy using the area under the curve. RESULTS: A total of 40 (76.9%) males and 12 (23.1%) females [mean age: 50.9 y (43.8 to 53.5 y)] were included. QMT [0.45 cm/m2 (0.42 to 0.48 cm/m2) vs. 0.67 cm/m2 (0.63 to 0.70 cm/m2)], QMFI [0.82 cm/m2 (0.77 to 0.87 cm/m2) vs. 1.12 cm/m2 (1.06 to 1.19 cm/m2)], FMT [0.19 cm/m2 (0.17 to 0.20 cm/m2) vs. 0.25 cm/m2 (0.23 to 0.27 cm/m2)], and FFI [0.38 cm/m2 (0.35 to 0.412 cm/m2) vs. 0.47 cm/m2 (0.44 to 0.50 cm/m2)] were significantly lower in patients with SO (P<0.01). A positive correlation with SMI was seen for all parameters in the entire cohort. The strongest correlation was exhibited by QMT (r=0.70) and QMFI (r=0.70) in males. The area under the curve of QMT, QMFI, FMT, and FFI were 0.98 (95% confidence interval: 0.96-1), 0.95 (0.89-1), 0.85 (0.75-0.96), and 0.80 (0.68-0.93), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: US-based assessment of sarcopenia has excellent diagnostic accuracy and correlates well with computed tomography-SMI in patients with SO. US may serve as an easy-to-use, point of care tool for assessing sarcopenia in SO with the advantage of repeated sequential assessment.},

Measuring muscle mass by image techniques has become a new area of research for the nutritional support field, extending our knowledge about muscle wasting and the impact of nutritional approaches in the critical care setting, although currently there is no universally accepted technique to perform muscle measurements by ultrasound. Because of this, we present this tutorial for nutrition support clinicians, in order to understand and perform muscle measurements by this reliable, accessible, low-cost, and easy-to-use technique. Reviewing issues such as quadriceps muscle anatomy, correct technique (do's and don'ts), identification of structures, and measurement of the rectus femoris and vastus intermedius muscles helps to acquire the basic concepts of this technique and encouraging more research in this field.},

abstract = {Background/Objectives: With technological advances, there has been a resurgence in ultrasound as a method to measure subcutaneous fat thickness. Despite the increased interest in this methodology, research comparing A-mode and B-mode ultrasound devices is lacking. Subcutaneous fat thickness measured by a low resolution (2.5 MHz) A-mode ultrasound and a high resolution (12 MHz) B-mode ultrasound were compared to the actual fat thickness in dissected cadavers. Subjects/Methods: Subcutaneous fat thickness of six cadavers was measured at the abdomen, thigh, triceps, and calf (plus chest for males and suprailiac for females) with both ultrasound devices before the cadavers were dissected and site-specific thickness was measured. Results: Correlations between both ultrasounds and the dissected measurement exceeded 0.90 at all sites with a few exceptions. At the abdomen, the relationship between the ultrasounds was 0.76, and the B-mode and dissected measurement was also 0.76. The correlation between dissection and A-mode was 0.75 for the suprailiac site, but it was not possible to discern the separation of tissue at this site when using the B-mode device. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) between the devices and the dissected measurement at any of the six sites. The mean difference in fat thickness between A-mode and B-mode was <0.7 mm at all sites except the calf (1.2 mm) Conclusion: With the exception of the suprailiac site, both A-mode and B-mode ultrasound are equally capable of providing measurements of subcutaneous fat thickness with an accuracy of <1 mm at most sites.},

abstract = {Muscle ultrasound is a valuable addition to the neuromuscular toolkit in both the clinic and research settings, with proven value and reliability. However, it is currently not fulfilling its full potential in the diagnostic care of patients with neuromuscular disease. This review highlights the possibilities and pitfalls of muscle ultrasound as a diagnostic tool and biomarker, and discusses challenges to its widespread implementation. We expect that limitations in visual image interpretation, posed by user inexperience, could be overcome with simpler scoring systems and the help of deep-learning algorithms. In addition, more information should be collected on the relation between specific neuromuscular disorders, disease stages, and expected ultrasound abnormalities, as this will enhance specificity of the technique and enable the use of muscle ultrasound as a biomarker. Quantified muscle ultrasound gives the most sensitive results but is hampered by the need for device-specific reference values. Efforts in creating dedicated muscle ultrasound systems and artificial intelligence to help with image interpretation are expected to improve usability. Finally, the standard inclusion of muscle and nerve ultrasound in neuromuscular teaching curricula and guidelines will facilitate further implementation in practice. Our hope is that this review will help in unleashing muscle ultrasound's full potential.},

We aimed to determine whether a low-cost, 2.5-MHz amplitude (A-mode) ultrasound, designed specifically for body composition assessment, could produce subcutaneous fat thickness measurements comparable to an expensive, 12-MHz brightness (B-mode) device. Fat thickness was measured on 40 participants (20 female, 20 male; 29.7 ± 11.1 y of age; body mass index 24.9 ± 4.5 kg/m2) at 7 sites (chest, subscapula, mid-axilla, triceps, abdomen, suprailiac and thigh) with both devices. Intraclass correlations exceeded 0.75 at all measurement sites. Mean differences in fat thickness were not significantly different (p > 0.05) and within ± 1.0 mm. Variability between devices was greatest at the abdomen, the site with the greatest thickness. The low-cost, low-resolution A-mode ultrasound provides subcutaneous fat thickness measurements similar to the more expensive, high-resolution B-mode ultrasound.},

abstract = {Preoperative nutrition status is an important determinant of surgical outcomes, yet malnutrition assessment is not integrated into all surgical pathways. Given its importance and the high prevalence of malnutrition in patients undergoing surgical procedures, preoperative nutrition screening, assessment, and intervention are needed to improve postoperative outcomes. This narrative review discusses novel methods to assess malnutrition and frailty in the surgical patient. The Global Leadership Initiative for Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria are increasingly used in surgical settings although further spread and implementation are strongly encouraged to help standardize the diagnosis of malnutrition. The use of body composition (ie, reduced muscle mass) as a phenotypic criterion in GLIM may lead to a greater number of patients identified as having malnutrition, which may otherwise be undetected if screened by other diagnostic tools. Skeletal muscle loss is a defining criterion of malnutrition and frailty. Novel direct and indirect approaches to assess muscle mass in clinical settings may facilitate the identification of patients with or at risk for malnutrition. Selected imaging techniques have the additional advantage of identifying myosteatosis (an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality for surgical patients). Feasible pathways for screening and assessing frailty exist and may determine the cost/benefit of surgery, long-term independence and productivity, and the value of undertaking targeted interventions. Finally, the evaluation of nutrition risk and status is essential to predict and mitigate surgical outcomes. Nascent to novel approaches are the future of objectively identifying patients at perioperative nutrition risk and guiding therapy toward optimal perioperative standards of care.},

We discuss the importance of quantifying skeletal muscle in the intensive care unit setting. We also identify the merits and limitations of various modalities that are capable of accurately and precisely measuring muscularity. Ultrasound is emerging as a potentially powerful tool for skeletal muscle quantification; however, there are key challenges that need to be addressed in future work to ensure useful interpretation and comparability of results across diverse observational and interventional studies. Ultrasound presents several methodological challenges, and ultimately muscle quantification combined with metabolic, nutritional, and functional markers will allow optimal patient assessment and prognosis. Moving forward, we recommend that publications include greater detail on landmarking, repeated measures, identification of muscle that was not assessable, and reproducible protocols to more effectively compare results across different studies.},

abstract = {Ultrasound (US) is an important imaging tool for skeletal muscle analysis. The advantages of US include point-of-care access, real-time imaging, cost-effectiveness, and absence of ionizing radiation. However, US can be highly dependent on the operator and/or US system, and a portion of the potentially useful information carried by raw sonographic data is discarded in image formation for routine qualitative US. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) methods provide analysis of the raw or post-processed data, revealing additional information about normal tissue structure and disease status. There are four QUS categories that can be used on muscle and are important to review. First, quantitative data derived from B-mode images can help determine the macrostructural anatomy and microstructural morphology of muscle tissues. Second, US elastography can provide information about muscle elasticity or stiffness through strain elastography or shear wave elastography (SWE). Strain elastography measures the induced tissue strain caused either by internal or external compression by tracking tissue displacement with detectable speckle in B-mode images of the examined tissue. SWE measures the speed of induced shear waves traveling through the tissue to estimate the tissue elasticity. These shear waves may be produced using external mechanical vibrations or internal “push pulse” ultrasound stimuli. Third, raw radiofrequency signal analyses provide estimates of fundamental tissue parameters, such as the speed of sound, attenuation coefficient, and backscatter coefficient, which correspond to information about muscle tissue microstructure and composition. Lastly, envelope statistical analyses apply various probability distributions to estimate the number density of scatterers and quantify coherent to incoherent signals, thus providing information about microstructural properties of muscle tissue. This review will examine these QUS techniques, published results on QUS evaluation of skeletal muscles, and the strengths and limitations of QUS in skeletal muscle analysis.},

abstract = {Background: Patients with critical illness can lose more than 15% of muscle mass in one week, and this can have long-term detrimental effects. However, there is currently no synthesis of the data of intensive care unit (ICU) muscle wasting studies, so the true mean rate of muscle loss across all studies is unknown. The aim of this project was therefore to systematically synthetise data on the rate of muscle loss and to identify the methods used to measure muscle size and to synthetise data on the prevalence of ICU-acquired weakness in critically ill patients. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, PubMed, AMED, BNI, CINAHL, and EMCARE until January 2022 (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews [PROSPERO] registration: CRD420222989540. We included studies with at least 20 adult critically ill patients where the investigators measured a muscle mass-related variable at two time points during the ICU stay. We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and assessed the study quality using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Results: Fifty-two studies that included 3251 patients fulfilled the selection criteria. These studies investigated the rate of muscle wasting in 1773 (55%) patients and assessed ICU-acquired muscle weakness in 1478 (45%) patients. The methods used to assess muscle mass were ultrasound in 85% (n = 28/33) of the studies and computed tomography in the rest 15% (n = 5/33). During the first week of critical illness, patients lost every day −1.75% (95% CI −2.05, −1.45) of their rectus femoris thickness or −2.10% (95% CI −3.17, −1.02) of rectus femoris cross-sectional area. The overall prevalence of ICU-acquired weakness was 48% (95% CI 39%, 56%). Conclusion: On average, critically ill patients lose nearly 2% of skeletal muscle per day during the first week of ICU admission.},

Contrary to most studies evaluating parameters related to sarcopenic obesity in the elderly, this study aims to evaluate the phase angle (PhA) and sarcopenia in young individuals pre- and post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A total of 69 volunteers (46 women and 23 men; 38.5 ± 8.1 years) participated in this study. Body composition and PhA were assessed using BIA. Sarcopenia was assessed using a handgrip strength test (HGS) and gait speed (GS), and appendicular lean mass (ALM) was assessed using Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA). The PhA was significantly lower (p < 0.0007) and the resistance (R) significantly higher (p = 0.0026) in the postoperative group. HGS was negatively correlated with R (r = −0.63669; p < 0.0001), hs-CRP (r = −0.45436; p = 0.0197), and leptin (r = −0.46505; p = 0.0043). GS was negatively correlated with R (r = −0.36220; p = 0.0254), and ALM was negatively correlated with reactance (r = −0.49485; p = 0.0034) and R (r = −0.65797; p ≤ 0.0001). PhA and other components of BIA provide a good correlation with sarcopenia, especially regarding the reduction in muscle function, in an early form, in individuals in the pre- and postoperative period of gastric bypass.},

abstract = {Objectives: Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is influenced by body composition quantity and quality in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and obesity. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) provides a noninvasive quantitative and qualitative body composition assessment. The aim of this study was to determine the role of phase angle (PhA), a BIA-measure of skeletal muscle quality and body cell mass, on CRF in patients with obesity and HFpEF. Methods: Fifty-nine consecutive outpatients with HFpEF underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing to measure CRF. Single-frequency segmental BIA was used to measure PhA and body composition quantity. Resting Doppler echocardiography and biomarkers were measured to assess cardiac function and systemic inflammation. Results: Compared with patients with lower PhA, patients with higher PhA (above mean 5.8°) presented a greater absolute peak oxygen consumption (VO2; 1.83 [1.3–2.1] versus 1.39 [1.1–1.6] L/min, P = 0.003), VO2 peak adjusted for body weight (17.5 [12.3–18.1] versus 13.3 [12.7–15.2] mL/kg/min, P = 0.040), and a lower edema index (48.7 [2.9] versus 51.4% [2.7], P < 0.001) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP; 64 [50–121] versus 183 [68–343.5] pg/dL, P < 0.001). In the overall sample, PhA was correlated with absolute VO2 peak (r = 0.468, P < 0.001), VO2 peak adjusted for body weight (r = 0.368, P = 0.004), VO2 peak adjusted for fat-free mass (r = 0.315, P = 0.015), edema index (r = –0.508, P < 0.001), and NT-proBNP (r = –0.579, P < 0.001). PhA remained a significant predictor for CRF even after adjustment for potential confounders and HFpEF severity. Conclusion: In patients with obesity and HFpEF, a greater PhA is an independent predictor for favorable CRF.},

abstract = {Background in 2010, the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) published a sarcopenia definition that aimed to foster advances in identifying and caring for people with sarcopenia. In early 2018, the Working Group met again (EWGSOP2) to update the original definition in order to reflect scientific and clinical evidence that has built over the last decade. This paper presents our updated findings. Objectives to increase consistency of research design, clinical diagnoses and ultimately, care for people with sarcopenia. Recommendations sarcopenia is a muscle disease (muscle failure) rooted in adverse muscle changes that accrue across a lifetime; sarcopenia is common among adults of older age but can also occur earlier in life. In this updated consensus paper on sarcopenia, EWGSOP2: (1) focuses on low muscle strength as a key characteristic of sarcopenia, uses detection of low muscle quantity and quality to confirm the sarcopenia diagnosis, and identifies poor physical performance as indicative of severe sarcopenia; (2) updates the clinical algorithm that can be used for sarcopenia case-finding, diagnosis and confirmation, and severity determination and (3) provides clear cut-off points for measurements of variables that identify and characterise sarcopenia. Conclusions EWGSOP2's updated recommendations aim to increase awareness of sarcopenia and its risk. With these new recommendations, EWGSOP2 calls for healthcare professionals who treat patients at risk for sarcopenia to take actions that will promote early detection and treatment. We also encourage more research in the field of sarcopenia in order to prevent or delay adverse health outcomes that incur a heavy burden for patients and healthcare systems.},

abstract = {The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) developed a practical clinical definition and consensus diagnostic criteria for age-related sarcopenia. EWGSOP included representatives from four participant organisations, i.e. the European Geriatric Medicine Society, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics-European Region and the International Association of Nutrition and Aging. These organisations endorsed the findings in the final document. The group met and addressed the following questions, using the medical literature to build evidence-based answers: (i) What is sarcopenia? (ii) What parameters define sarcopenia? (iii) What variables reflect these parameters, and what measurement tools and cut-off points can be used? (iv) How does sarcopenia relate to cachexia, frailty and sarcopenic obesity? For the diagnosis of sarcopenia, EWGSOP recommends using the presence of both low muscle mass + low muscle function (strength or performance). EWGSOP variously applies these characteristics to further define conceptual stages as 'presarcopenia', 'sarcopenia' and 'severe sarcopenia'. EWGSOP reviewed a wide range of tools that can be used to measure the specific variables of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. Our paper summarises currently available data defining sarcopenia cut-off points by age and gender; suggests an algorithm for sarcopenia case finding in older individuals based on measurements of gait speed, grip strength and muscle mass; and presents a list of suggested primary and secondary outcome domains for research. Once an operational definition of sarcopenia is adopted and included in the mainstream of comprehensive geriatric assessment, the next steps are to define the natural course of sarcopenia and to develop and define effective treatment. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

@article{Martinez-Romero2017,
abstract = {Background: Ontologies and controlled terminologies have become increasingly important in biomedical research. Researchers use ontologies to annotate their data with ontology terms, enabling better data integration and interoperability across disparate datasets. However, the number, variety and complexity of current biomedical ontologies make it cumbersome for researchers to determine which ones to reuse for their specific needs. To overcome this problem, in 2010 the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) released the Ontology Recommender, which is a service that receives a biomedical text corpus or a list of keywords and suggests ontologies appropriate for referencing the indicated terms. Methods: We developed a new version of the NCBO Ontology Recommender. Called Ontology Recommender 2.0, it uses a novel recommendation approach that evaluates the relevance of an ontology to biomedical text data according to four different criteria: (1) the extent to which the ontology covers the input data; (2) the acceptance of the ontology in the biomedical community; (3) the level of detail of the ontology classes that cover the input data; and (4) the specialization of the ontology to the domain of the input data. Results: Our evaluation shows that the enhanced recommender provides higher quality suggestions than the original approach, providing better coverage of the input data, more detailed information about their concepts, increased specialization for the domain of the input data, and greater acceptance and use in the community. In addition, it provides users with more explanatory information, along with suggestions of not only individual ontologies but also groups of ontologies to use together. It also can be customized to fit the needs of different ontology recommendation scenarios. Conclusions: Ontology Recommender 2.0 suggests relevant ontologies for annotating biomedical text data. It combines the strengths of its predecessor with a range of adjustments and new features that improve its reliability and usefulness. Ontology Recommender 2.0 recommends over 500 biomedical ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal platform, where it is openly available (both via the user interface at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/recommender , and via a Web service API).},

Methods: A search was performed in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science and Scopus; and in the gray literature up to January 2022. Studies with individuals with CVDs were included, to evaluate the association between PhA and the inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-18, IL-1$\beta$, IL-33, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$, C-reactive protein (CRP), toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR 4, nuclear factor $\kappa$B, pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules, lipopolysaccharides, interferon-$\gamma$–inducing factor, and JAK STAT. Results: We identified 755 articles and, after an eligibility analysis, 5 studies were included. The inflammatory markers investigated in the studies were CRP, TNF-$\alpha$, and IL-33. In patients with CVDs, PhA was negatively associated with CRP and TNF-$\alpha$ in 80% and 100% of the studies, respectively. Conclusions: The present results suggested that PhA is inversely associated with inflammatory markers in individuals with CVDs, and its clinical use is encouraged for better therapeutic planning.},

abstract = {Neuronal target recognition is performed by numerous cell-surface transmembrane proteins. Correct folding of these proteins occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen of the neuronal cells before being transported to the plasma membrane of axons or dendrites. Disturbance in this protein folding process in the ER leads to dysfunction of neuronal cell surface molecules, resulting in abnormal neuronal targeting. In this study, we report that the ER-resident protein Meigo in Drosophila, governs the dendrite targeting of olfactory projection neurons (PNs) along the mediolateral axis of the antennal lobe by regulating Toll-6 localization. Loss of Meigo causes Toll-6 mislocalization in the PNs and mediolateral dendrite targeting defects, both of which are suppressed by Toll-6 overexpression. Furthermore, we found that the ER-chaperone protein, Gp93, also regulates the mediolateral targeting of PN dendrites by localization of the Toll-6 protein. Gp93 overexpression in the PN homozygous for the meigo mutation, partially rescued the dendrite targeting defect, while meigo knockdown decreased Gp93 expression levels in cultured cells. These results indicate that the ER-proteins Meigo and Gp93 regulate dendrite targeting by attenuating the amount and localization of cell surface receptors, including Toll-6, implying the unexpected but active involvement of ER proteins in neural wiring.},

abstract = {Importance: Cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder defined by variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, affects more than 30000 individuals in the US and approximately 89000 worldwide. Absent or decreased function of the CFTR protein is associated with multiorgan dysfunction and shortened life expectancy. Observations: CFTR is an anion channel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Loss of function leads to obstructed exocrine glands. Of people with cystic fibrosis in the US, approximately 85.5% have the gene variant F508del. Manifestations of cystic fibrosis in patients with the F508del gene variant begin in infancy with steatorrhea, poor weight gain, and respiratory symptoms (coughing, wheezing). As people with cystic fibrosis age, chronic respiratory bacterial infections cause loss of lung function and bronchiectasis. With the availability of universal newborn screening in multiple countries including the US, many people with cystic fibrosis are asymptomatic at diagnosis. With multidisciplinary care teams that included dietitians, respiratory therapists, and social workers, treatment of cystic fibrosis can slow disease progression. Median survival has improved from 36.3 years (95% CI, 35.1-37.9) in 2006 to 53.1 years (95% CI, 51.6-54.7) in 2021. Pulmonary therapies for patients with cystic fibrosis consist of mucolytics (eg, dornase alfa), anti-inflammatories (eg, azithromycin), and antibiotics (such as tobramycin delivered by a nebulizer). Four small molecular therapies, termed CFTR modulators, that facilitate CFTR production and/or function have received regulatory approval. Examples are ivacaftor and elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor. For example, in patients with 1 F508del variant, the combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor improved lung function from -0.2% in the placebo group to 13.6% (difference, 13.8%; 95% CI, 12.1%-15.4%) and decreased the annualized estimated rate of pulmonary exacerbations from 0.98 to 0.37 (rate ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.55). Improved respiratory function and symptoms have lasted up to 144 weeks in postapproval observational studies. An additional 177 variants are eligible for treatment with the elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor combination. Conclusion: Cystic fibrosis affects approximately 89000 people worldwide and is associated with a spectrum of disease related to exocrine dysfunction, including chronic respiratory bacterial infections and reduced life expectancy. First-line pulmonary therapies consist of mucolytics, anti-inflammatories, and antibiotics, and approximately 90% of people with cystic fibrosis who are 2 years or older may benefit from a combination of ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor..},

abstract = {Introduction: Neutrophils are central to inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF) and their accumulation in airways contrasts with their inability to efficiently eliminate microorganisms. We hypothesize here that intrinsic phenotypic and functional modifications of circulating neutrophils could be present in CF patients in the absence of acute infection and under stable clinical conditions. Methods: After information and written consent, 45 cystic fibrosis patients were recruited, as well as 25 volunteers from the {\'{E}}tablissement Fran{\c{c}}ais du Sang. Blood samples were collected to analyze the phenotype of whole blood neutrophils using a panel of 24 markers and an Aurora spectral cytometer (Cytek Bioscience). Neutrophils were isolated by ficoll gradient sedimentation and spontaneous apoptosis was studied using dual Annexin-V/7-AAD. Results: The number of neutrophils was higher in CF patients compared to controls (7.07 ± 3.953 106/mL vs. 3.97 ± 1.89 106/mL, mean±SD, P < 0.0001). The flow cytometry analysis showed a significant decrease in CD15, CD16, CD62L, CD10, CXCR2 expression and a significant increase in GLUT1 and LOX1 expression in neutrophils isolated from CF patients compared to the control group. In addition, we found a decrease in the proportion (mean±SD) of the conventional CD16hi/CD62Lhi neutrophils in CF patients (75.54±7.76% vs. 91.49 ± 2.36%, P < 0.0001) in favor of a CD16hi/CD62Llo subpopulation (15.57 ± 7.85% vs. 3.63 ± 1.77%, p < 0.0001) with a very mature (CD10hi, CD33lo) and activated (CD11bhi) phenotype, and a CD16lo/CD62Lhi subpopulation (5.98 ± 3.11% vs. 3.24 ± 1.61%, P = 0.0002) with an immature phenotype (CD10lo, CD33hi) (Fig. 1). The percentage of apoptotic neutrophils after 16 h incubation was significantly lower in CF patients (69.64 + 4.21% vs. 84.44 ± 1.91%, P = 0.0025). Conclusion: We have shown that there are persistent phenotypic changes in neutrophils in stable CF patients, with an increase in the number of circulating neutrophils associated with a defective apoptosis. Membrane markers analysis showed a dysregulation in the expression of differentiation and metabolic markers associated with the expansion of CD16lo/CD62Lhi and CD16hi/CD62lo subpopulations, as described in acute inflammation, especially in sepsis [1].},

abstract = {Persistent neutrophil-dominated lung inflammation contributes to lung damage in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the mechanisms that drive persistent lung neutrophilia and tissue deterioration in CF are not well characterized. Starting from the observation that, in patients with CF, c-c motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)+ monocytes/macrophages are abundant in the lungs, we investigate the interplay between monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils in perpetuating lung tissue damage in CF. Here we show that CCR2+ monocytes in murine CF lungs drive pathogenic transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) signaling and sustain a pro-inflammatory environment by facilitating neutrophil recruitment. Targeting CCR2 to lower the numbers of monocytes in CF lungs ameliorates neutrophil inflammation and pathogenic TGF-$\beta$ signaling and prevents lung tissue damage. This study identifies CCR2+ monocytes as a neglected contributor to the pathogenesis of CF lung disease and as a therapeutic target for patients with CF, for whom lung hyperinflammation and tissue damage remain an issue despite recent advances in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-specific therapeutic agents.},

abstract = {Objectives CF related diabetes (CFRD) is still one of the major comorbidities in CF and is affecting 30% of adult CF patients. CFRD leads to a poorer outcome with decline in lung function, increase lung infections and impaired nutritional status. In the decade of CFTR modulator therapy that will have great impact on life quality and life expectation it is even more important to understand the inflammatory pathways that lead to CFRD. In our study we want to investigate the connection between CFRD and impaired lung function. We want to examine if there are different expressions of cytokines and bacterial load in the airways of CF patients depending on their glucose tolerance. Methods Children with CF attending the CF Centre at Sk{\aa}ne university hospital Lund, Sweden, were included in the study. During 2021–2022, we collected sputum samples from the participants when they performed oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Clinical patient data were collected from our national CF patient registry. Sputum samples are analyzed for neutrophil elastase and inflammatory cytokines using ELISA and Mesoscale. Bacterial load in sputum will be assessed by quantification of bacterial 16SDNA using RT-PCR. Results During the study period we enrolled 16 patients, age 11 to 17 years. 62% are homozygote for $\Delta$F508 mutation. 37,5% are chronically colonized with gram negative bacteria. 32% of our patients had a normal OGTT, 6,5% hade diagnose CFRD. 13% of our patients had impaired glucose tolerance and 48% had indeterminate glycemia. Laboratory analyses are currently ongoing. Conclusion Understanding the immunological pathways in CFRD lung disease is more important with the increasing age of CF patients to prevent worsen lung function and cardio-vascular complications due to CFRD. In our research we aim to identify key players in the immunological pathway in the progress of developing CFRD. Our aim is to identify new treatment targets and new diagnostic markers in the early phase of CFRD.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most lethal autosomal recessive diseases due to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation. The incidence of CF is about one in every 2000 to 3000 live births. CFTR mutation leads to thick and sticky secretions in the body's ducts with epithelial cells with CFTR protein, especially in the airways. Consequently leads to infection and inflammation in the airways. CF is a progressive disease that affects patients' pulmonary function, affecting patients' quality of life. In recent years, the use of complementary medicine to reduce the symptoms of CF has been considered by health care providers, and about 66% of patients with CF have used one of the complementary methods. This manuscript aimed to mention three influential lifestyle factors that affect airways inflammation. We found that pro-inflammatory components and gases in the air pollution increase the risk of antibiotic use, early acquisition of methicillin resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and decrease pulmonary function in CF patients. Cold air leads to respiratory infection, airway inflammation, dryness, and thickening mucus. Anxiety influences the immune response, promote an elevation in sympathetic activity, increases IgE production, and shifts Th1 to Th2 allergic-type response, which could promote airway. Regular physical activity can modulate the autonomic balance and may enhance the physiological recovery of the vagal sympathetic interaction, which acts on the frequency of ciliary beats, mucus secretion, and mucociliary clearance. Also, exercise decreases pulmonary exacerbation frequency, reduces mucus viscosity and elasticity, and increases ventilation and respiratory flow. According to the mentioned results, we concluded that air pollution, cold environment, and anxiety might act as pro-inflammatory factors, and regular exercise may act as an anti-inflammatory factor for the respiratory system in CF patients. We suggest that more clinical studies should be done to confirm their effects.},

abstract = {The airway surface liquid (ASL) is a thin sheet of fluid that covers the luminal aspect of the airway epithelium. The ASL is a site of several first-line host defenses, and its composition is a key factor that determines respiratory fitness. Specifically, the acid–base balance of ASL has a major influence on the vital respiratory defense processes of mucociliary clearance and antimicrobial peptide activity against inhaled pathogens. In the inherited disorder cystic fibrosis (CF), loss of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channel function reduces HCO3− secretion, lowers the pH of ASL (pHASL), and impairs host defenses. These abnormalities initiate a pathologic process whose hallmarks are chronic infection, inflammation, mucus obstruction, and bronchiectasis. Inflammation is particularly relevant as it develops early in CF and persists despite highly effective CFTR modulator therapy. Recent studies show that inflammation may alter HCO3− and H+ secretion across the airway epithelia and thus regulate pHASL. Moreover, inflammation may enhance the restoration of CFTR channel function in CF epithelia exposed to clinically approved modulators. This review focuses on the complex relationships between acid–base secretion, airway inflammation, pHASL regulation, and therapeutic responses to CFTR modulators. These factors have important implications for defining optimal ways of tackling CF airway inflammation in the post-modulator era.},

On the one hand, type 2 inflammation restores tissue homeostasis and contributes to the resolution of inflammation following an injury. On the other hand, type 2 response-activated immune cells may become dysregulated or chronically activated, causing tissue fibrosis. Among the type 2 cytokine-driven inflammatory pathways, the transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF$\beta$), interleukin (IL)-17, IL-33, and IL-13 have been identified as essential mediators in patients suffering from CF. Given their critical role, we firmly believe that an adequate comprehension of the type 2-mediated pathways can identify attractive targets to decrease pharmacologically the inflammation and fibrosis occurring in the pulmonary tissue of patients suffering from CF.},

abstract = {Background: Mucociliary clearance (MCC) results from an effective interaction between the mucus layer and the normal coordinated ciliary beating. Ciliary dyskinesia, or an abnormal ciliary beating, is defined as an abnormal ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and/or ciliary beat pattern (CBP), and can be primary, or secondary to chronic infection or inflammation. In cystic fibrosis (CF), MCC is impaired due to dehydrated mucus, but recent data suggested a ciliary dyskinesia in CF patients, but it is unknown if this is primary, or secondary to chronic inflammation. The aim of this study is to evaluate if ciliary dyskinesia is primary or secondary in CF patients. Methods: Ciliated epithelial samples were obtained by nasal brushing from 10 CF patients and 5 healthy volunteers. Beating cilia were recorded using digital high-speed videomicroscopy at 37 °C. Ciliary functional analysis (CFA) was assessed by CBF and by the percentage of dyskinetic CBP (%DK). CFA was repeated after Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) cell culture. Results: Our results confirm that ciliary dyskinesia is increased in CF patients compared with healthy volunteers, with no significant difference in CBF (13.3 ± 2.9 Hz vs. 12.5 ± 1.1 Hz, P = 0.542), but a higher %DK (31.4 ± 8.2% vs. 17.4 ± 7.1%, P = 0.007). However, after ALI cell culture, there is no difference between CF patients and healthy volunteers in CBF (15.6 ± 2.1 Hz vs. 15.0 ± 2.3 Hz, P = 0.860), or in %DK (11.7 ± 2.3% vs. 16.2 ± 7.5%, P = 0.371). Conclusions: Our pilot study confirms that ciliary dyskinesia is present in CF patients, and may contribute to impaired MCC. However, after ALI cell culture, CFA is similar between CF patients and healthy volunteers, suggesting that ciliary dyskinesia may be secondary to chronic respiratory inflammation in CF patients.},

abstract = {Rationale: Type 2 inflammation has been described in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Whether loss of CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) function contributes directly to a type 2 inflammatory response has not been fully defined. Objectives: The potent alarmin IL-33 has emerged as a critical regulator of type 2 inflammation. We tested the hypothesis that CFTR deficiency increases IL-33 expression and/or release and deletion of IL-33 reduces allergen-induced inflammation in the CF lung. Methods: Human airway epithelial cells (AECs) grown from non-CF and CF cell lines and Cftr+/+ and Cftr-/- mice were used in this study. Pulmonary inflammation in Cftr+/+ and Cftr-/- mice with and without IL-33 or ST2 (IL-1 receptor-like 1) germline deletion was determined by histological analysis, BAL, and cytokine analysis. Measurements and Main Results: After allergen challenge, both CF human AECs and Cftr-/- mice had increased IL-33 expression compared with control AECs and Cftr+/+ mice, respectively. DUOX1 (dual oxidase 1) expression was increased in CF human AECs and Cftr-/- mouse lungs compared with control AECs and lungs from Cftr+/+ mice and was necessary for the increased IL-33 release in Cftr-/- mice compared with Cftr+/+ mice. IL-33 stimulation of Cftr-/- CD4+ T cells resulted in increased type 2 cytokine production compared with Cftr+/+ CD4+ T cells. Deletion of IL-33 or ST2 decreased both type 2 inflammation and neutrophil recruitment in Cftr-/- mice compared with Cftr+/+ mice. Conclusions: Absence of CFTR reprograms airway epithelial IL-33 release and licenses IL-33-dependent inflammation. Modulation of the IL-33/ST2 axis represents a novel therapeutic target in CF type 2-high and neutrophilic inflammation.},

abstract = {Background: The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) reports a high prevalence of asthma (34.6%) in people with Cystic Fibrosis (PwCF). While our current understanding of this relationship is limited, a type 2 inflammatory (T2) phenotype has often been identified in CF patients. Research question: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the eosinophilic CF T2 inflammatory phenotype and CF-related pulmonary outcomes and microbiological data. Study design and methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of adult patients with CF (18 and older; n = 93) receiving their care at University of Virginia Medical Center adult program from January, 2013 through December, 2018. Data collected included demographic data, CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) mutation, CF comorbidities, medications, Absolute Eosinophil Counts (AEC) in cells/µL and Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in IU/mL. Results: Of 93 patients screened for study eligibility, 74 were included in the final analysis; 19 patients were excluded due to lack of longitudinal data across the study timeline. Lung function decline correlated with increased AEC (p < 0.001) and IgE (p < 0.001) even when adjusting for covariates: age, gender, presence of Pseudomonas spp., MRSA, other bacterial spp., Aspergillus spp., and other fungi (p < 0.001). Univariate analysis demonstrated that people with CF who experienced more than 2 exacerbations requiring hospitalizations and/or intravenous antibiotics a year were more likely to have high AEC (p = 0.018). Logistic regression showed that as AEC increases, the probability that the measurement was taken during a CF exacerbation increases (p = 0.0039). A linear mixed model showed that each additional annual exacerbation event increased on average the log IgE by 0.04. (p = 0.015). This finding remained stable in a multivariate model (p = 0.0145). When adjusted for atopy, log IgE increases as the number of exacerbation events increases (p = 0.022). There was no association between AEC and IgE and microbiological colonization. Interpretation: This study has shown that in CF patients, T2 inflammation based on serum AEC and IgE correlated with pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalizations and/or intravenous antibiotics, independent of bacterial airway colonization. In addition, lung function decline correlated with increased IgE and AEC. Further studies are needed to explore these correlations and potential impact on treatment.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, responsible for the synthesis of the CFTR protein, a chloride channel. The gene has approximately 2000 known mutations and all of them affect in some degree the protein function, which makes the pathophysiological manifestations to be multisystemic, mainly affecting the respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and reproductive tracts. Currently, the treatment of the disease is restricted to controlling symptoms and, more recently, a group of drugs that act directly on the defective protein, known as CFTR modulators, was developed. However, their high cost and difficult access mean that their use is still very restricted. It is important to search for safe and low-cost alternative therapies for CF and, in this context, natural compounds and, mainly, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) appear as promising strategies to assist in the treatment of the disease. CAPE is a compound derived from propolis extracts that has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, covering important aspects of the pathophysiology of CF, which points to the possible benefit of its use in the disease treatment. To date, no studies have effectively tested CAPE for CF and, therefore, we intend with this review to elucidate the role of inflammation and oxidative stress for tissue damage seen in CF, associating them with CAPE actions and its pharmacologically active derivatives. In this way, we offer a theoretical basis for conducting preclinical and clinical studies relating the use of this molecule to CF.},

abstract = {Exercise is associated with release of inflammatory mediators in the circulation and there is evidence that the exercising muscles and tendons are sources of interleukin-6. Due to the catabolic effects of some cytokines, increased release in circulation might contribute to alterations in body composition in adults with cystic fibrosis. We hypothesised that exercise of moderate intensity would generate increased blood concentrations of some inflammatory mediators. We investigated the change in blood concentrations of interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor alpha and their soluble receptors after a structured exercise (box stepping) of intensity similar to that encountered during activities of daily living in 12 adults with cystic fibrosis and mean (95% confidence interval) FEV1 55.6 (44.4, 66.8)% predicted, body mass index 23.0 (21.3, 24.6) kg/m2 and 12 healthy subjects. The increments post-exercise for all inflammatory mediators and lactate corrected for the work performed until voluntary exhaustion were greater for patients, while the total work was less for patients (all p < 0.01). Daytime variability of the inflammatory mediators was assessed in eight patients and was less than the change due to exercise. We report greater increments in circulating concentrations of some cytokines with moderate exercise in adults with cystic fibrosis compared to healthy subjects. {\textcopyright} 2005 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

abstract = {Rationale: Diaphragm thickness is increased in cystic fibrosis (CF), but it shows a marked variability between patients. The variable response of the diaphragm to loading may reflect the combined and opposite effects of training by the respiratory disease and systemic inflammation. Objectives: To assess the impact of systemic inflammation on diaphragm and limb muscle strength and bulk in adult patients with CF. Methods: In 38 stable patients with CF and 20 matched control subjects, we measured fat-free mass (FFM), inspiratory muscle strength, diaphragm thickness, quadriceps and biceps strength and cross-sectional area, and circulating levels of leukocytes, C-reactive protein, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$, tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ soluble receptors, and immunoglobulin G. Measurements and Main Results: Patients had increases in several inflammatory markers that correlated with the severity of lung disease and nutritional depletion. Compared with control subjects, patients with CF had increased diaphragm thickness and inspiratory muscle strength and showed a trend toward a reduction in limb muscle strength and bulk. Multiple regression analyses identified FFM and airway resistance as independent predictors of diaphragm thickness, but systemic inflammation had no (or only a minor) predictive effect on FFM, inspiratory muscle strength, diaphragm thickness, and limb muscle strength and bulk. Conclusions: In patients with CF, the intensity of systemic inflammation does not account significantly for the variance of FFM and diaphragm or limb muscle strength and bulk. Training of the diaphragm in CF occurs despite the presence of systemic inflammation.},

abstract = {Background: In cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, it has been suggested that systemic inflammation may be an important risk factor for poor health outcomes. The relationship of plasma inflammatory biomarkers to lung function and hospitalization history remains largely unexplored. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 58 consecutive, clinically stable adults from the CF Clinic at St. Paul's Hospital (Vancouver, Canada). Blood levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, granzyme B (GzmB), chemokine C-C motif ligand 18 (CCL18/PARC), surfactant protein D (SP-D), lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein, and soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and LPS levels were measured using a Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Spirometry was also performed. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to assess relationships of the blood biomarkers to lung function. Results: Lung function impairment was independently associated with elevated plasma levels of CRP (P < 0.01), IL-6 (P = 0.04), IL-1beta (P < 0.01), and LBP (P < 0.01), Increasing age (P < 0.01), reduced body mass index (P = 0.02), prior hospitalizations (P = 0.03), and presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in sputum cultures (P < 0.01) were also associated with reduced lung function. Elevated concentrations of LPS in plasma were associated with a previous history of hospitalization (p<.05). There was a trend towards an increase in plasma IL-6 (p=.07) and IL-1beta (p=.06) levels in patients who were previously hospitalized. Conclusions: IL-6 and IL-1beta are promising systemic biomarkers for lung function impairment and history of hospitalization in adult patients with CF.},

abstract = {Objective: We compared body composition measurement in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) by using non-invasive methods (skinfold thicknesses and bioelectrical impedance analysis [BIA]) with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Methods: Seventy-six adults with CF (mean age 29.9 ± 7.9 y, mean body mass index 21.5 ± 2.5 kg/m2) were studied. Body composition was measured to calculate fat-free mass (FFM) using DXA, the sum of four skinfold thicknesses, and BIA (predictive equations of Lukaski and of Segal). Results: Mean FFM values ± standard deviation measured using DXA were 54.8 ± 7.3 kg in men and 41.2 ± 3.9 kg in women. Mean FFM values measured using BIA/Lukaski were 51.5 ± 7.8 kg in men and 40.4 ± 4.9 kg in women (P < 0.0005 for men, not significant for women for comparison with DXA). Mean FFM values measured using BIA/Segal were 54.2 ± 7.5 kg for men and 44.1 ± 5.9 kg for women (not significant for men, P < 0.0005 for women for comparison with DXA). Mean FFM values measured using skinfolds were significantly higher than those for FFM with DXA (57.2 ± 7.2 kg in men, 43.3 ± 4.3 kg in women, P < 0.0005 for comparison with DXA). The 95% limits of agreement with FFM using DXA were, for men and women, respectively, -8.3 to 1.7 kg and -6.4 to 4.8 kg for BIA/Lukaski, -4.8 to 3.6 kg and -3.1 to 8.9 kg for BIA/Segal, and -2.8 to 7.3 kg and -1.5 to 5.7 kg for skinfolds. Conclusion: This study suggests that skinfold thickness measurements and BIA will incorrectly estimate FFM in many adults with CF compared with DXA measurements of FFM. These methods have limited application in the assessment of body composition in individual adult patients with CF. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: The purpose of this pilot study was to compare body composition metrics obtained by two portable bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) devices with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) among adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) before and after a resistance exercise training program. Methods: Participants with CF were assessed using DXA, single-frequency BIA (SFBIA), and multiple-frequency BIA (MFBIA) to quantify percent body fat (%Fat), fat mass (FM), and fat-free mass (FFM) at baseline and after a home-based resistance training intervention comprised of 36, 1 h sessions completed in 12–14 weeks. Repeated measures analysis of variance, paired samples t-tests, Cohen's d effect sizes, and Pearson's correlations were used to compare differences between and within methods at baseline and post-intervention. Results: Ten participants (15.8 ± 2.2 yr, 60.1 ± 15.1 kg) completed the assessments. At baseline, both SFBIA and MFBIA scales significantly underestimated %Fat and FM and overestimated FFM, with small to moderate effect sizes. Post-intervention, small, non-significant differences were found between DXA and both BIA scales for all body composition metrics. Significant changes in %Fat and FFM were observed with DXA. MFBIA displayed less constant error than SFBIA when compared to DXA for pre-and post-intervention assessments for %Fat (MFBIA: pre and post −2.8 and −0.8 vs. SFBIA: −4.6 and −2.0), FM (−0.4 and −0.4 vs. −3.0 and −1.1), and FFM (+0.8 and +0.6 vs. +3.1 and +1.3). Near-perfect correlations were observed at both time points between DXA and each BIA scale. Conclusions: Portable BIA results should be interpreted with caution, and further validation studies in CF patients are needed prior to clinical use.},

@article{Wright2022,
abstract = {Background: Body mass index (BMI) is a useful tool for predicting clinical outcomes, but BMI cannot accurately determine two component measurements (fat and lean tissue). In some disease states, alterations in body composition are a primary symptom. There is increasing evidence of the poor ability of BMI to predict body fat in individuals and the value of information about lean mass [1]. In children with CF, fat-free mass is thought to be associated with respiratory function and outcome [2]. Dualenergy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) can be useful in measuring compartments, but reference data are limited. Skinfold thickness data from the 1970s is available, but it is an invasive technique. U.K. reference data have been produced using a gold-standard four-compartment model (DEXA, waist circumference, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), total body water) for individuals aged 5 to 20 (2012) [1] and aged 2 to 5 (2020) that Table 1 Fat mass index, fat-free mass index (FFMI), and associated centiles with age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and dietary advice given. ONS, oral nutritional supplement; CFRD, cystic fibrosis–related diabetes (Table Presented)can be used to reference across a variety of techniques, including BIA. BIA is a noninvasive technique that uses low-charge electrical currents to measure resistance at different frequencies against different tissues. Metabolically active lean mass and water are good conductors of current and will show low resistance. Fat mass and fat-free mass in kilograms is divided by height squared in meters to give a fat mass index (FMI) and fatfree mass index (FFMI). Methods: We obtained consent for and conducted BIA before and 3 to 4 months after elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor initiation in nine patients using a BIA machine suitable for ages 6 and older and determined weight, height, BMI, diet history, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry as appropriate. We provided bespoke advice regarding exercise and degree of fat reduction after this test. Exercise advice was to promote weightbearing exercise for bone health or to increase energy expenditure (in the case of adiposity).We ensured that the child had voided their bladder and was lying flat and still while the procedurewas conducted. To reduce intraobserver error, the same clinician was used on each repeat measurement. FMI and FFMI were calculated and compared with reference data centile charts [1]. Results: Results are shown in Table 1. BIAwas able to identify early changes in adiposity, using FMI centile plots, alongside normal BMI. Low FFMI was also identified, which is linked to poorer outcomes in CF. Conclusions: BIA can identify risk of adiposity or becoming overweight more quickly than BMI or weight trend on a centile chart. It helps tailor information to the child and family and is useful for those who have impaired glucose tolerance in terms of showing risks of metabolic syndrome. It can give incentive for exercise adjustment, is noninvasive and quick, and can identify, earlier thanweight or BMI, the need for dietary change (e.g., reducing nutritional supplements or food fortification). Interand intra-observer error is a challenge, but that can be mitigated but reducing the number of clinicians conducting BIA and providing regular training},

abstract = {Introduction: Physical Activity (PA), particularly moderate-high intensity, benefits general health and prognosis in Cystic Fibrosis (CF). PA declines in the teenage years. The optimal training program to promote PA remains unknown. Home-based group exercise supervised over telehealth has not been investigated. Aim: A single-centre telehealth, pilot study to explore feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of a progressive home-based group high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention in young people with CF who don't meet Australian PA recommendations. Methods: 8 young people (10-17 years) were recruited during clinic visits. The physiotherapist supervised 30-60 min exercise sessions delivered via telehealth 3×/week for 2 school terms (10 weeks each). Participants were provided with basic gym equipment and performed core, resistance and aerobic exercises in a progressive HIIT format. Feasibility and acceptability were measured by the proportion of sessions attended and completed without technical interruption. Efficacy measures included: Spirometry (FEV1, % predicted); cardiopulmonary exercise testing using the Bruce Treadmill Protocol (peak VO 2); functional muscle tests (vertical jump height, medicine ball throw, hand grip strength, knee-extension dynamometry, sit-ups in 30 s); and muscle mass measured by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis. Efficacy data was assessed using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests. Results: 8 subjects, 3 male, median age 15 (12-17) years were recruited and all completed the study. Of the 55 sessions, participants attended a median of 70% (44-89) and only 4 sessions (<1%) experienced technical interruption. Baseline and efficacy data are presented in Table 1. Conclusions: Progressive supervised home-based group HIIT provided over telehealth was feasible and acceptable. Lung function, exercise capacity and muscle mass remained stable and there were significant improvements in strength measures. Larger randomised controlled trials are needed to explore the efficacy of telehealth-supervised group exercise interventions in people with CF.},

abstract = {Sarcopenia, a pathologic deficiency of muscle mass and function, has emerged as an important secondary feature of many chronic disease states. For adults with end stage liver disease, there are multiple mechanisms which contribute to sarcopenia and its presence has proven to be an important predictor of morbidity and mortality. In children, there are only a limited number of reports which investigate the role of sarcopenia in liver disease. These studies, which are discussed and summarized in this review, report small, single-center analyses with dissimilar study cohorts and varying clinical definitions. Still, children meeting the study entry criteria have sarcopenia with a reported prevalence of 24–70%. When assessed, sarcopenia appears to be associated with more severe disease but is independent of the Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) score and does not correlate with age, gender, or traditional anthropometric measures such as weight, height, weight-for-height, or body mass index (BMI). While individual studies may identify sarcopenia as a statistically significant risk factor for certain post-transplant outcomes such as longer ICU stay, longer duration of intubation, repeat operation, development of serious infection, longer hospital stay, death, or long-term growth failure, such associations are not consistently replicated across studies. Finally, although various methods of muscle mass quantification are utilized, the most reported is the total psoas muscle surface area (tPMSA) on computed tomography. This method, along with others such as skeletal muscle area and skeletal muscle index, have had normative values recently defined and these collective efforts should enable researchers a common basis of comparison when delineating sarcopenia, and its impact, across various study populations in future investigations – including in children with liver disease.},

abstract = {Background: Assessment of nutritional status in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is clinically relevant. Methods to measure nutritional status should be reliable and non-invasive, and reference values should be available. Aim: To compare weight and height measurements and measurements of specific body compartments in children with CF. Methods: In a cross-sectional survey of 58 children with CF (28 females), we compared height and weight (expressed as: weight-for-height, body mass index (BMI), height-for-age and weight-for-age) with fat mass (skinfold sum (SFS)), muscle mass (upper arm circumference (UAC)) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Results were expressed as Z-scores, using Dutch reference values. Results: BMI and weight-for-height were within the normal range (mean Z-score (range): -0.13 (-1.5, 2.7) and -0.02 (-1.7, 2.8)). Weight and height corrected for age were below normal (mean Z-score (range): -0.79 (-2.4, -0.05) and -1.2 (-2.8, 1.4) (P-0.01)). Lean body mass by skinfold sum (LBMsfs), UAC and BIA were also significantly below reference values (mean Z-score (range): -0.9 (-2.2, 1.8), -0.95 (-2.4, 1.8) and -1.1 (-3.6, 1.0) (P-0.01)). Lean body mass (LBM) by BIA correlated with LBMsfs. BIA systematically underestimated LBM in both CF patients and in control subjects. Conclusion: Nutritional status of children with CF must be evaluated, using age-corrected weight and height expressed in Z-score. LBM estimated by SFS, UAC and by BIA appear to be useful, although longitudinal studies in CF children should be performed to evaluate their clinical significance in detecting changes in nutritional status. {\textcopyright} 2002 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.

Methods: Datawere analysed for 20 CF adults (10 male, mean ± SD baseline age 33.5 ± 8.8 years, mean ± SD FEV1 33.6 ± 6.5%predicted, mean ± SD BMI 19.9 ± 2.2 kg/m2), who received Lumacaftor-Ivacaftor for 12 months, and had body composition measured (multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis, SECA, Germany) at 0, 6 and 12 months. Changes($\Delta$) inweight, fatfree mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) were determined. Paired t-tests and Pearson's correlations were undertaken. Results: At six months, mean ± SD weight and fat mass significantly increased ($\Delta$Weight0-6 mth: 2.3 ± 3.9 kg (p = 0.02); $\Delta$FM0-6 mth: 2.1 ± 2.7 kg (p = 0.003)), with no further increase by 12 months ($\Delta$Weight6-12 mth: 0.3 ± 3.1 kg (p = 0.66); $\Delta$FM6-12 mth: 0.3 ± 2.7 kg (p = 0.27)). No changes were seen in mean FFM ($\Delta$FFM0-12 mth: 0.4 ± 1.8 kg (p = 0.62). Lower baseline BMI correlated with greater weight gain (r = -0.50, p = 0.02) and FM (r = -0.46, p = 0.04). No-one became overweight; 50% gained >5% weight. No-one lost >5% FFM whilst 20% gained >5% FFM. Lower baseline BMI correlated with greater weight and FM gains at 12 months (r = -0.50, p = 0.02 and r = -0.46, p = 0.04). $\Delta$FFM0-12 mth correlated with baseline FEV1% (r = 0.46, p = 0.04) and $\Delta$FEV1 %0-12 mth (r = 0.45, p = 0.047). Conclusions: Weight and fat mass gains seen after six months on Lumacaftor-Ivacaftor plateau by 12 months. Underweight patients are more likely to achieve body composition gains. Preservation of FFM contrasts with earlier work showing declining FFM in association with severe lung disease. Mechanisms underlying body composition changes require further investigation, including mediation via improved appetite, salt/hydration, exercise or via amelioration of catabolism related to reduced exacerbations.},

abstract = {Objective: Pediatric patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) are at high risk of inactivity and poor physical fitness. The aim of this study was to assess the main correlates of exercise capacity in a cohort of children and young adults on chronic HD. Methods: Twelve patients on chronic HD (median age 15.6years; range 9.1-24.2) underwent a 6-minute walking test (WT), spirometry, a 1-minute chair stand test, and the measurement of lower extremity strength. Demographic data, anthropometry (dry weight, height, body mass index, and skinfold thickness, all expressed as standard deviation scores [SDS]), biochemistry (serum albumin, hemoglobin, creatinine, C-reactive protein, bicarbonate), bioimpedance analysis, HD adequacy indices (spKt/V and eKt/V), left ventricular mass index, and medications were also recorded. Results: There was a significant correlation among the distance covered during the WT (median 552m, range 186-670), forced vital capacity (87.8% of predicted, range 49.7-136), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (86.7%, range 54.7-126.7), and peak expiratory flow (75.5%, 49.7-105.1). All of these indices positively correlated with the weight SDS (r 0.69-0.85), pre-HD serum creatinine (0.57-0.77), and serum albumin (0.60-0.77) and negatively correlated with weekly erythropoietin dose per kilogram of body weight (from -0.64 to -0.83), with P values ranging from < .05 to < .0005. Lower extremity strength (median 11.5kg, range 3-15) positively correlated with the number of stands at the chair stand test (median 33, range 18-47; r 0.73, P < .05) and serum albumin (r 0.83, P < .01). Distance at the WT, forced vital capacity, lower extremity strength, and the number of stands at the chair stand test all negatively correlated with C-reactive protein levels (r from -0.81 to -0.67, P < .05). Conclusion: Our findings show that protein-energy wasting and chronic inflammation are strongly correlated with the exercise capacity of children and young adults on chronic HD. {\textcopyright} 2013 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.},

abstract = {Objectives: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive disease which influences lung function and survival. The optimal nutritional status and recent body compositions, remarkably higher fat free mass (FFM) than the fat mass (FM) are important factors interrelated with better outcomes. The aim of our study was to evaluate nutritional status,body composition and pulmonary function in CF pediatric patients and establish if exist any gender differences and aged related trends in the assessed parameters. Methods: In 2018, patients between 8 and 18 years in stable condition, during the annual assessment, with FEV1% > 40% were included to the study. BMI z-scores were calculated and compared to the national reference data. Body composition by bio-impedance analysis and pulmonary function (PF) were determined. Fat free mass index (FFMI) and the fat mass index (FMI) were calculated according to the following formula: FFMI = FFM/height2, FMI = FM/height2, respectively. Results: One hundred nine CF subjects (53% male), with mean age 12,99 ± 3,2 years were assessed. 50% of them were homozygotes F508del and 90% with pancreatic insufficiency. Normal BMI z-score was observed in 75%. Mean FEV% was 91,85 ± 15,43; mild PF had 90% of the group. No differences in BMI z-score, FEV%, FVC%, PEF% between girls and boys were noticed, however PF were significantly worsening with age (F = 2,221, p =,00043), particularly between 8 and 9 years old. BMI z-score fluctuating with age with higher values between 8 and 9 years and lower between 17 and 18 years. FFMI increased with age (p < 0001) in all patients and was higher in boys (p < 0,001), but FMI was greater in girls (p < 0,001). Conclusion: Most of the patients characterized a good nutritional and pulmonary status. Body composition was changing with age. Differences in the body content between girls and boys were observed, not like in BMI z-score values. Pulmonary function does not depend on gender, nevertheless decreases early in the middle childhood.},

Aim: the aim of our research was to assess the quality of life and nutritional status of adult patients with cf in Hungary and to determine the correlations between nutritional status, lung function and the quality of life. in Hungary, we are the first to study the relationship between nutritional status and the quality of life in adult cf patients. Material and methods: 57 patients with cf from Hungary of both sexes were studied, all of them aged over 18. an assessment of the quality of life with a questionnaire was conducted among them. their nutritional status was measured with the bioelectrical impedance analysis. the most recently measured feV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) values for the patients were analyzed. in order to assess the quality of life, the validated hungarian translation of the disease-specific cystic fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) - teen/adult version for ages 14 through adulthood - was used. Results: the nutritional status is worse in female patients than in male. undergoing lung transplantation did not have any impact on the nutritional status. however, we found significant differences in the feV1 values between the patients who underwent transplantation and those who did not. no strong correlation was found between any parameters of the nutritional status, feV1 and the domains of the quality of life. in the mean values of the quality of life domains, the highest score appeared in the eating domain, while the lowest one was found in the weight domain. we did not find any significant differences between the quality of life of male and female patients, except for the respiratory symptoms domain, where women's scores were lower. however, this result was not confirmed by feV1 data. transplant patients' quality of life was higher than non-transplant ones in almost all domains, with 6 domains where statistically significant differences were found. the transplant cf patients, however, had lower scores in the weight and body image domains. cf patients with lower bMi had lower quality of life than their peers. Muscle mass percentage did not differ between groups. feV1 showed a statistically significant correlation with six of the cfQ-R domains. Conclusions: our research is the first disease-specific assessment of the quality of life among hungarian adult patients with cf. in Hungary, we are the first to study the relationship between nutritional status and the quality of life in adult cf patients. we conclude that early dietetical interventions should be implemented to improve patients' condition and the quality of life.},

(1) However, there are conflicting reports of effects on body composition after bariatric surgery in adults (2, 3, 4) and concerns that rapid weight loss adversely affects skeletal muscle mass. This review aimed to assess muscle and fat mass changes following sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in adolescents. Methods: Patients receiving SG surgery between August 2016 and June 2019 had measurements of weight, height and body mass index (BMI). Body fat and skeletal muscle mass percentage were measured using multi frequency, segmental, whole body bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) (InBody S10). We have previously shown this machine to correlate highly with DEXA, the gold standard in young people with cystic fibrosis. (5) Measurements were recorded prior to surgery and at most recent follow-up. Pubertal stage and ethnicity were recorded for all patients. Results: Nineteen patients underwent SG; Table 1 shows patient characteristics & results. Table 2 shows measurements pre surgery & follow-up. Conclusion: Adolescents who underwent SG successfully reduced weight and BMI predominantly with a loss of fat rather than muscle. BIA is a practical, non- invasive & time efficient method of assessing body composition. (Table Presented).},

Therefore, consecutive adult CF patients after LT who attended our CF outpatient service between January 2012 and July 2015 were included. Data on BC measured by 3 compartment model bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), general nutritional status as evaluated by BMI, as well as 25-hydroxy(OH)-vitamin D levels at initial visit and follow-ups were collected retrospectively and correlated with lung function parameters. Results: In total, 58 patients (59% female, median age: 30.1 y) were included. The majority (81%) carried the F508del allele, were pancreatic insufficient (PI; 97%), diabetics (80%; CFRD or NODAT), or had reduced bone density (88%). Median BMI was 19.6 kg/m2. More than a quarter of subjects (16/58; 28%) were malnourished (BMI<18.5 kg/m2), none of the patients was classified as obese. BMI significantly correlated with lung function. Malnourished patients had significantly reduced lung function compared to normal/overweight patients. BMI, as well as the single BIA parameters PA, TBW, FFM, and BCM were univariate predictors of lung function as assessed by FEV1%. 139 BIAs performed in 58 patients during longitudinal follow-up were analysed, demonstrating a steady rise in median BMI, PA and BCM. In parallel lung function fell slowly, but constantly during the same period (FEV1% from 88% to 80.5%). In malnourished patients, a dramatic reduction of -43% in FEV1% was observed in the longitudinal term, whereas the FEV1% decline in the normal/overweight patients was only -4%. Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent but was not associated with lung function after transplantation. Conclusion: BMI, PA, TBW, FFM, and BCM in contrast to vitamin D levels are univariate predictors of lung function in adult CF patients after LT. Diabetes (CFRD or NODAT) and vitamin D deficiency are highly prevalent in posttransplant CF patients. Malnourished patients had significantly impaired lung function within the longitudinal follow - up. Continuous care by a multidisciplinary and specialized team of dietitians and gastroenterologists trained in CF care might improve nutritional status in CF patients after LT.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is predominantly a lung disease but is also characterised by impaired skeletal muscularity and a reduction in fat-free mass. We aimed to test the hypothesis that clinical and anthropometric parameters would determine fat-free mass impairment in adolescents with CF. We measured the fat-free mass index (FFMI) using bioelectrical impedance, the lung function using spirometry, the number of shuttles as a measure of exercise tolerance and the reported physical activity in children and young people with CF in a tertiary centre at King's College Hospital, London, UK. CF-related liver disease was diagnosed by abnormal liver enzymes and/or ultrasonography. We studied 28 children and young people (11 male) with a median (interquartile range (IQR)) age of 15 (13–17) years. They had a median (IQR) FFMI of 13.5 (11.6–15.1) kg/m2. The FFMI significantly correlated with age (rho = 0.568, p = 0.002), number of shuttles (rho = 0.691, p < 0.001) and reported hours of activity per day (rho = 0.426, p = 0.024). The median (IQR) FFMI was significantly higher in male [15.1 (13.1–18.6) kg/m2] compared to female participants [12.7 (11.6–14.1) kg/m2, p = 0.008]. The median (IQR) FFMI was significantly lower in the 10 (36%) participants with liver disease [11.9 (11.5–13.4) kg/m2] compared to the FFMI in the remaining 18 participants without liver disease [14.4 (12.5–15.9) kg/m2, p = 0.027]. Conclusion: Fat-free mass increases with increasing age and growth in adolescents with CF. Physical activity exerts a beneficial effect on fat-free mass, and CF-related liver disease negatively affects fat-free mass in adolescents with CF.What is Known:• Health behaviours in adolescence influence lifelong health in cystic fibrosis (CF).• A normal body mass index in CF might fail to reveal a low fat-free mass (FFM), and quality of life in CF is strongly associated with a reduced FFM.What is New:• FFM increases with increasing age and growth in adolescents with CF. • Physical activity exerts a beneficial effect, and liver disease negatively affects FFM in adolescents with CF.},

abstract = {Background: There is a preliminary link between fat-free mass, disease severity, and lung function. The CF Foundation (CFF) recommends a goal BMI of >22 for female and >23 for male adults with CF. Research shows a BMI in excess of 25 is not advantageous. The aim of this project is to improve BMI, combat BMI education fatigue, and increase patient body satisfaction. Methods: Patients had their body composition measured during clinic with a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) scale. CF clinic dietitian was responsible for interpreting results and providing nutritional recommendations, the social worker created surveys to analyze body satisfaction after each test, and the physical therapist administered exercise assessments and provided recommendations. Motivational interviewing was incorporated by all disciplines to help patients actualize goals. Results: A total of 84 patients were tested from June 2018 to April 2019. During this time, 53% of patients increased their BMI. 100% of patients received verbal and written test interpretations. A portion of tested patients completed the initial and secondary surveys. Body satisfaction was measured before testing, immediately after testing, and after follow-up testing using a Likert scale. Of the patients who repeated testing, 12% identified as being “not at all satisfied” with their bodies before testing decreased to 0% of patients identifying this way after the follow-up test. The portion of patients who identified themselves as being “very satisfied” with their body went from 20% before testing to 44% after the follow-up testing. The percent of patients below the CFF BMI guidelines decreased from 44.3% to 42%. Median BMI for the center has steadily increased from 22.6 to 23.2. Male patients below the recommended CFF guidelines have shown the most improvement by increasing their median BMI from 20.2 to 20.9. Female patients below the CFF BMI guidelines improved from a median BMI of 19.9 to 20.2. Data from patients who have repeated the body composition testing show that 53% have increased their BMI between testing. Of the patients who identified as being below the BMI guidelines, 50% who have repeated testing increased their BMI. A portion of overweight and obese patients have decreased their BMI. Conclusion: Through the utilization of body composition testing, our center was able to adequately improve our median BMI value. Introducing BIA provided a new intervention that increased patient engagement with the process of changing BMI. The harmony of dietition, social worker, and physical therapist interventions proved to be useful in the clinic setting. We aim to combat BMI education fatigue and ambiguity. By tracking each patient's body composition, we were able to identify barriers we may have otherwise missed. This awarded us the opportunity to deploy more advanced social techniques, such as Motivational Interviewing, for goal actualization. All patients, both underweight and overweight, seemed to have benefited from this project. Future plans include tracking skeletal muscle gains and losses, body fat percentage fluctuations, resulting mental health changes, and associated FEV1 changes, if any.},

abstract = {Objectives: The positive effects of weighted exercise training on balance and exercise capacity in different diseases with low bone mineral density have been demonstrated. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of exercise training with weighted vest on lean body weight, balance and functional capacity in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods: Weighted exercise training was carried on treadmill that the patients wore a weighted vest (4-8% of body weight). Exercise training was performed in 70% of the maximal heart rate for 6 weeks, 3 days a week, 30-45 minutes a day. Body composition, body fat mass, and lean body mass were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Balance was evaluated with Flamingo Balance Test (static balance) and Y Balance Test (dynamic balance). Functional exercise capacity was assessed using 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Results: Six CF patients completed the weighted exercise training. Two of the four patients who did not complete the study stopped exercising due to acute lung infection and two others due to transportation problems. Demographic characteristics of the patients who completed and did not complete were similar (p>0.05). At the end of the training, there was a significant improvement in 6MWT distance and Flamingo Balance test score (p<0.05). No differences were found in the body composition and Y balance test after training (p>0.05). Conclusion: Exercise training with a weighted vest in CF improves the functional exercise capacity and the static balance. We need a greater number of patients and control group for evaluating the effects on the body composition.},

@article{Dress2022,
abstract = {Background: Body mass index (BMI) greater than the 50th percentile has long been the nutritional target for children with cystic fibrosis (CF), but increasing numbers of children have become overweight or obese [1].Although previous studies have found that higher BMI is correlated with better lung function, newer research highlights that lean body mass is associated with good lung function and health [2]. A high percentage of body fat and lowskeletal muscle mass is common in individuals with CF at all BMI levels, suggesting that BMI is a suboptimal marker of nutritional status [3]. The effect of modulators on body composition in children with CF has not been comprehensively documented. Based on previous studies, largely in adolescents and adults, we hypothesize that children with CF on modulator therapy will experience a sustained increase in fat mass. The effect of extended modulator therapy on skeletal muscle mass is unknown. Methods: This abstract uses baseline data from a longitudinal, observational study that assessed the BMI and body composition of children aged 6 to 11 with CF who were poised to initiate elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ELX/TEZ/IVA) therapy and who had (n = 27) or had not (n = 10) been treated with modulator therapy. Modulator treatment and BMI data were extracted from the medical record, and body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) using InBody 770 equipment. Results: Significant differences were noted at baseline assessment between those who were on modulator treatment before enrollment and those na{\"{i}}ve to modulator therapy (Figure 1). Children in the previous modulator treatment group had been on therapy for an average of 3.7 years (range 1.9–4.5 years). Those na{\"{i}}ve to modulatorwere younger on average at study enrollment (8.4 vs 9.7 years, p = 0.05). Children previously on modulators were noted to have higher BMI (mean BMI percentile 73% vs 54%, p = 0.07), fat mass index (5.03 vs 3.15 kg/m2, p = 0.01), and percentage body fat (25.5% vs 16.9%, p = 0.007) than those na{\"{i}}ve to modulators. Lean BMI (13.9 vs 13.7 kg/m2, p = 0.45) and skeletal muscle mass index (7.1 vs 6.9 kg/m2, p = 0.31) were comparable.(Figure Presented)Figure 1. Score distribution of percentage body fat of individuals on modulator therapy and those who were modulator na{\"{i}}ve Conclusions: Our baseline data offered a novel opportunity to identify modulator effects over several years on body weight and composition for children with CF. Data suggest that extended modulator therapy is associated with a persisting increase in body weight and fat mass but not skeletal muscle mass of prepubescent children. These data suggest a need for nutritional and physical activity interventions to optimize overall improvement with modulator therapy. The further effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA therapy on weight, body composition, and muscle strength is being evaluated.},

abstract = {Background: Malnutrition in cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with poor prognosis for survival. Weight monitoring and body mass index (BMI) are standards to evaluate nutrition status, with goal BMI 22 and BMI 23 established for female and male adults respectively. Historically these set points determined better outcomes, but these measures lack information on body composition. The discovery of CFTR modulators has changed the goals for nutrition for many people with CF. The CFTR modulators contribute to changes in body composition, and the response is variable. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is useful in assessing the effect of CFTR modulators on body composition to provide an individualized nutrition plan of care. The inclusion of BIA in routine CF clinic appointments can guide nutrition recommendations and identify other traits associated with change in body composition. Methods: During routine CF clinic appointments, 34 adult patients (age 19–56 years, 18 male, 16 female) completed BIA. They were offered BIA based on clinic schedule and eligibility to start elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ ivacaftor CFTR modulator. The BIAwas completed using the Tanita TBF 300- A scale. The baseline body composition results were discussed with the patient during the visit. The author instructed all patients to monitor weightweekly at home after initiating the CTFR therapy and individualized diet education as directed by the BIA results with consideration given to the initial data published onweight gain for elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor, as well as longer-term data from ivacaftor. The initial study design was baseline and a 6-month reassessment but this was extended to 12 months due to the COVID 19 pandemic-related in-person clinic visit restrictions. Results: At reassessment, 23 of the patients (68%) on elexacaftor/ tezacaftor/ivacaftor gained weight (mean total weight gain 5.02 kg, mean fat mass gain 3.19 kg, mean fat free mass gain 2.4 kg) and 11 (32%) lost weight (mean total weight lost 3.45 kg, mean fat mass lost 2.42 kg, mean fat free mass lost 0.91 kg). The comparison of body composition changes for males and females who gained weight showed greater fat mass gain for females and a greater fat free mass gain for males (P > 0.05). There was a significant difference (P = 0.019) in mean total weight change for the double $\Delta$F508 group (n = 22, 0.65 kg) and the group with 1 copy of $\Delta$F508 (n = 12, 4.76 kg). The 11 patients that had lost weight (mean 3.45 kg) were all in the double $\Delta$F508 group. Per discussion with the patients, they attributed weight loss to increased physical activity due to improved lung function, increased exercise and/or dietary adjustment to avoid excess weight gain, or mental health issues. A comparison of weight change for patients with lower baseline lung function < FEV1 50% to those with higher lung function FEV1 > 50% was not statistically significant. Conclusion: The BIA has become a useful component of the standard CF clinic appointment to individualize nutrition recommendations for patients with CF, but CF clinics do not always have access to a BIA scale due to cost. Further research on changes in body composition with CFTR modulators can guide nutrition professionals in their recommendations. This sample population, although small, indicates that the response to CFTR modulators includes varying levels of change in body composition.},

abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to identify methodological aspects involved in determining anthropometric measurements among studies assessing the nutritional status of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods: A search of the literature was performed on MEDLINE via Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The population comprised children and adolescents with CF. Observational studies and clinical trials using anthropometric and body composition measures and indices determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance assessment (BIA) were included. Use of a standardized procedure for data collection was defined when details on the instruments and their calibration were given, the measuring procedures were described, and when it was clear measures had been determined by a trained team, or the use of an anthropometric reference manual was cited. Data extracted were expressed as absolute and relative frequencies. Results: A total of 32 articles were included, and a total of 233 measures or indices were observed. The most frequently used measures were body mass index (kg/m2; 35%), weight (kg; 33%), and height (cm; 33%). Among the 28 studies that used anthropometric measures, 21 (75%) provided a complete or partial description of the measurement instruments used, 3 (11%) reported information on equipment calibration, 10 (36%) indicated the measurement procedures employed by assessors, and 2 (7%) stated a trained team had carried out the measurements. Conclusions: The poor description of measuring procedures precluded a meaningful evaluation of data quality. Scientific debate on this theme can help raise awareness of the need to ensure quality in collecting and fully presenting data.},

abstract = {Background: Nutritional status in cystic fibrosis (CF) is routinely assessed using the body mass index (BMI). Measurements of lean body muscle, e.g. fat free mass (FFM), may better correlate to lung and respiratory muscle function in CF (Sheikh S et al. Front Pediatr 2014;2:33). Portable bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) devices give body composition analysis avoiding exposure to ionising radiation. Aims: To evaluate whether FFM by BIA, rather than BMI, better correlate with pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength and exercise capacity. Methods: BMI was calculated and body composition analysis obtained with the Inbody S10. Lung function was assessed by spirometry and respiratory muscle function data using the Micro RPM. Exercise tolerance was assessed with the modified shuttle walk test. Results: Twenty-seven children and young adults were assessed. Their (median, (range)) age was 15.3 (12.2-19.0) years, BMI z-score-0.09 (-2.20-1.19), FFM 37.00 (25.20-67.50) kg, fat mass 11.50 (4.20-21.50) kg, FEV z-score-1.72 (-5.57-0.82), FVC z-score-0.94 (-5.84-1.08), maximum inspiratory pressure 78 (32-107) mmH 0, maximum expiratory pressure 104 (59-160) mmH 0, number of shuttles 88 (32-150). FFM, but not BMI correlated with lung function, respiratory muscle strength and exercise tolerance: Conclusion: Portable bioelectrical impedance analysis may provide important body composition analysis results in CF patients.},

abstract = {Objectives: Nutritional status is an important factor which determines the respiratory outcome in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Body composition (BC), and more specifically fat free mass (FFM), impacts on respiratory function in adults; however data concerning pediatric cohorts are sparse. The gold standard method to estimate BC is dual X-Ray absorptiometry (DXA), but it is radiating, time consuming and frequently unavailable. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is reproducible and easily feasible. Our objective is to validate an equation adapted to the pediatric CF population in order to calculate FFM by BIA. We also aim to investigate the correlation between BC and pulmonary function testing (PFT). Methods: CF children and non-CF controls are evaluated prospectively using fourelectrode multiple-frequency BIA (Aminostats Bio-ZM II). DXA (Hologic QDR 4500) is performed a few minutes later without modification of patients' hydration status. Results of FFM obtained by BIA are compared to those calculated by DXA in order to validate the accuracy of the BIA equation. Correlation between FFM and PFT (FEV1, maximum inspiratory pressure) is also evaluated. Results: The equation proves accurate in CF children. BC of CF patients is under evaluation and will be compared to that of controls matched for age and sex. Correlation between BC and PFT will be presented. Conclusion: BIA is a helpful method to estimate BC. We have validated an equation adapted to the pediatric CF population.

abstract = {Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with osteoporosis and incident fracture. This study assessed independent predictors of baseline and 2-year changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in adults with CF. Methods: Sixty-four adult patients with CF, ages 18-57, were recruited from the Massachusetts General Hospital Cystic Fibrosis Care Center. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed at the spine and radius at baseline and 2 years (in 39 subjects). Estimates of fat-free mass index (FFMI) and fat mass index (FMI) were determined using height, weight, and tetrapolar bioelectric impedance analysis. All subjects completed lung spirometry within 1 month of the study visit. Linear regression models evaluated predictors of baseline BMD Z-scores and change in PA spine BMD Z-score over 2 years. Two definitions of low BMD were studied based on Z-score (≤-1.0 and ≤-2.0). Results: Low BMD was present in 52% of subjects. Subjects with low BMD were more likely to be male (67% vs. 32%, P = 0.009), were more likely to be currently using glucocorticoids (21% vs. 0%, P < 0.001), had lower percent body fat (P = 0.04), and were more likely to have had a previous fracture (60% vs. 46%, P = 0.007). In multivariable models, greater FFMI and height, but not greater FMI, were associated with greater BMD. In multivariable models, low forced vital capacity (FVC) and greater FMI were associated with greater loss of BMD at the PA spine over two years. Conclusions: Male sex, short stature, and low lean mass are associated with low BMD in CF. Greater adiposity and lower lung function are predictors of negative change in BMD Z-score over 2 years.},

abstract = {Background: Although there is some evidence that the progression of lung disease associated with protein malnutrition and metabolic impairments contribute to muscle mass atrophy and dysfunction, the causes of exercise limitation in patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) are still poor understood. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to characterize the functional aspects of CF adult patients. Secondarily, we aimed to evaluate the association between pulmonary function, nutritional status and functional capacity variables. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, twenty-one adult patients with CF underwent spirometry, whole-body plethysmography, carbon dioxide diffusion capacity, bioelectrical impedance analysis, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), six-minute walk test (6MWT) and quadriceps maximal isometric strength and endurance. According to data distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test), statistical analysis used Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test for comparisons, and Pearson's test for correlations. The significance level was set at 5%. Results: The patients presented with reduced peak VO2, distance in the 6MWT (6MWD), fat-free mass, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength, and quadriceps endurance. There were associations between pulmonary function variables and the results of exercise tests (CPET and 6MWD), as well as between static hyperinflation and CPET variables, and peripheral muscle function (force and endurance) and 6MWD. Conclusions: Adult patients with CF have impaired exercise tolerance, nutritional status, and peripheral muscles' strength and endurance. There are associations between exercise capacity, pulmonary function and skeletal muscles' performance in these patients. {\textcopyright} 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract = {Background: Malnutrition is an indicator of a poor prognosis in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Traditionally, the growth of children with CF is monitored by using height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) measurements, but these techniques do not provide any insight into the nature of the child's body composition. The investigation of body composition in the population would be beneficial due to it expanding our understanding of the disease process, enabling the assessment of the effectiveness of medical and nutritional interventions, and may identify those children at most risk of deterioration. Hand-to-foot bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is simple and non-invasive, making it particularly suitable for use in children. There is insufficient evidence of the validity of hand-to-foot BIA compared with air-displacement plethysmography (ADP) as the criterion method in pediatric CF patients. Objective: Assess the validity of hand-to-foot BIA against ADP through measures of Body Fat percentage (BF%), Fat Mass (FM) and Fat Free Mass (FFM) in a sample cohort of CF patients attending treatment at the CF Center at the Goryeb Children's Hospital.. Design: Body composition was measured by hand-to-foot BIA and ADP in 15 patients (60% males) on the same day. Statistical Analysis: Paired comparisons were made between hand-tofoot BIA and ADP in terms of body fat percentage, fat mass (lb) and fat free mass (lb) using the paired t-test. Results: Average age was 13.9 years (SD = 2.9) with 60% males. Average BMI was 20.7 kg/m2 (SD = 5.0). Results from paired comparisons showed a marginally lower body fat percentage for BIA [mean body fat percentage for BIA was 18.0% vs. 20.4% for ADP; p = 0.064]. Significantly lower fat mass was observed for BIA [mean fat mass for BIA was 23.0 lbs vs. 25.4 lbs for ADP; p = 0.047]. Fat free mass for BIA was, however, significantly higher for BIA [mean fat free mass for BIA was 93.5 lbs vs. 90.6 lbs for ADP; p = 0.032]. Conclusions: Significant differences were highlighted between the two methods in terms of fat mass and fat free mass. This indicates that based on the data, we could not validate the use of BIA for those two measures in the assessment of body composition assessment in pediatric CF patients.Future analyses will focus on examining differences/agreement between the two methods by gender and age group. Future research should look to; expand the sample size and increase to particpation of females due to their worse prognosis; use a control group of healthy pediatric subjects for comparison and classification of body composition; perform longitudinal repeat assessments to provide insight into the changes in body compositon in CF pediatric patients.},

Weight increased as well as FM and FFM (FM more than FFM especially in F/F). This can be due to physical activity adherence: 3 F/F reduced or stopped physical activity after ETI Conclusion: FFM is more strongly associated with lung function in CF compared to BMI. A consistent increase in FM is associated with a high risk to develop obesity. Pts on ETI show an increase of FM more than FFM after 3 months of treatment. The body composition should be regularly assessed in pts on ETI also to detect those who stop physical activity on a voluntary basis. Further research is needed to understand how body composition changes in both the F/F and F/MF cohorts over time},

abstract = {Background and aims: Cystic fibrosis related diabetes mellitus (CFRD) occurs in approximately 19% of adolescents and 40-50% of adults with CF. It's the result of a partial to complete insulin deficiency, leading not only to hyperglycaemia, but also to loss of muscle mass and induction of a catabolic state. Therefore, insulin is the only recommended therapy for CFRD.Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) has been associated with improved glycaemic control in CFRD in small studies, if compared to multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy, mostly due to better coverage of dietary requirements of these patients (high calories, not carbohydrate restrictions, several snacks during the day). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of insulin therapy optimization combined to a structured educational program (training to Sensor Augmented Pump -SAP-therapy and carbohydrates counting) on metabolic control and body composition in patients with CFRD requiring insulin therapy Materials and methods: 22 patients agreed to participate in the program and, at the end of it, switched to SAP therapy. 29 patients continued the outpatient checks without joining the program. Patients belonging to both groups were re-evaluated 2 years after the baseline evaluation. Results: Patients in the educational program group demonstrated a substantial improvement in glycometabolic control (HbA1c 7.4±1.4 to 6.5±0.6%; average blood glucose 8.5±1.6 to 7.4±1.1 mmol/L; Glucose management indicator -GMI 7.2±0.9 to 6.5±0.5%; time in range -TIR 64.2±18.0 to 80.38±10.1%; time above range -TAR 31.0±18.8 to 16.2 ±9.1%; time below range -TBR 4.76±3.5 to 3.0±2.0%, P<0.05) and in body composition, assessed with bioimpedance analysis (fat free mass -FFM 78.9±8.6 to 85.1±7.0%, total body water -TBW 57.9±6.3 to 63.2 ±6.7 L, P<0.05). The same parameters didn't differ from basal to final evaluation in patients in the control group. Conclusion: In conclusion, a structured educational program resulting in therapy optimization leads to a significative improvement in glycometabolic control and, consequently, in body composition, due to the known anabolic effects of insulin therapy.},

abstract = {Background: Nutrition is closely related to mortality and pulmonary and respiratory muscle function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We initially validated results from a bioelectrical impedance device against dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). We then determined whether fat free mass assessed by a portable impedance device rather than body mass index (BMI) better correlated with pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength and exercise capacity in CF patients. Methods: Eighteen young people and adults (median age 19, range 12–39 years) with CF had dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and direct segmental multi-frequency impedance analysis. Body composition, pulmonary function, respiratory muscle function and exercise tolerance using the impedance device were measured in 29 young people with CF with median age 15 (range 12–19) years. Main findings: There was a significant correlation between impedance and absorptiometry results (r2 = 0.947). Fat free mass correlated with the forced vital capacity z-score (r = 0.442, p = 0.016), maximal inspiratory pressure (r = 0.451, p = 0.014) and exercise tolerance (r = 0. 707, p < 0.001). BMI z-scores did not significantly correlate with pulmonary or respiratory muscle function. Subjects with a fat free mass z-score of ≤2 had a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s z-score (p = 0.007), lower forced vital capacity z-score (p = 0.001), higher residual volume z-score (p = 0.042), lower maximal inspiratory pressure (p = 0.039), more days of intravenous antibiotics per year (p = 0.016) and a higher rate of chronic infections (p = 0.006). Principal conclusions: Fat-free mass measured by impedance correlated better with pulmonary and respiratory muscle function and exercise capacity than BMI.},

abstract = {In the presence of chronic lung inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF), increased oxygen free radical generation occurs and is postulated to cause an increased turnover of nutrient antioxidants. In addition, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency significantly reduces absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. CF patients are routinely supplemented with vitamin E preparations. The additional supplementation of $\beta$-carotene has been also suggested. Therfore, the aim of the study was to determine the correlation between not supplementing $\beta$-carotene and clinical status of CF patients. The study encompassed 52 CF patients. Serum $\beta$-carotene levels were measured in all patients. The nutritional status (body height and weight, bioimpedance analysis of body components) and clinical expression of the disease (lung function and exocrine pancreatic function) were also assessed. The levels of $\beta$-carotene (20.6±27.0 $\mu$g/dL) were significantly lower than reference values. The existence of a statistically significant correlation between serum $\beta$-carotene and fecal elastase-1 (p<0.003) and FEV1 (p<0.03) was stated, $\beta$-carotene levels correlated also with body height and weight Z-scores (p<0.007 and p<0.003, respectively) and lean body mass and body cell mass (p<0.05 and p<0.03, respectively). The levels of $\beta$-carotene in non-supplemented CF patients seems to depend strongly on the clinical course of the disease. In case of severe expression of the disease and in malnourished patients, special emphasis should be put on $\beta$-carotene supplementation.},

However, the impact of IVAT on total energy expenditure (TEE) is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in TEE and its main components after IVAT administered at home. Body composition measured by skinfold thickness and bio-impedance analysis, energy intake (EI) assessed by a weekly diary, REE measured by indirect calorimetry (IC), TEE assessed by a technique using 24-h heart-rate monitoring method and physical activity (PA) monitored using an activity diary (AD) were assessed in 16 patients (9 boys and 7 girls) aged 12.1 ± 2.3 y (range, 7.1-14.6 y), before and after 28 ± 4 d including a 14-d IVAT course. After IVAT, weight increased significantly by 1.9% (32.1 ± 7.5 versus 32.7 ± 7.6 kg; p < 0.05), while fat mass and fat free mass increased non significantly. EI increased by 4.6% (10,797 ± 3,039 versus 11,320 ± 3,074 kJ/d; p < 0.05). TEE was not affected by IVAT (7,014 ± 1,929 versus 7,081 ± 1,478 kJ/d) whereas REE decreased by 4.1% (5,295 ± 909 versus 5,093 ± 837 kJ/d; p < 0.05), resulting in 9.3% increase in PA assessed by AD converted to metabolic equivalent tasks (MET) (37.0 ± 3.1 versus 40.7 ± 4.5 MET; p < 0.05). The improvement in nutritional status after IVAT is not related to a decrease in TEE, but probably to an increase in EI and a decrease of REE after IVAT. After IVAT, the reduction in REE is probably compensated by an increase in PA in CF patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The energy demands of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) vary depending on pancreatic function, body composition, lung function, and clinical status. In clinical practice, predictive equations are used to determine energy requirements yet do not reliably account for these factors. Research regarding energy requirements during CF pulmonary exacerbation (CFPEx) and clinical stability is conflicting. The aim of this study was to investigate potential within-individual changes in measured resting energy expenditure (mREE) using indirect calorimetry (IC) at the commencement and completion of intravenous antibiotic treatment (IVABx) for CFPEx and during clinical stability. Secondary aims were to investigate potential differences between predicted resting energy expenditure (pREE) using Schofield equation and correlations between clinical factors with mREE. METHODS: Body composition using bioimpedance analysis and mREE were conducted at three time points: commencement of IVABx; completion of IVABx; and clinically stable period thereafter. RESULTS: Twenty-eight adults with CF completed at least one valid IC measurement. No significant within-person changes in mREE and body composition parameters were observed across time points. The mREE was positively correlated with fat-free mass (kg; r = 0.6; P = 0.008). The mREE was significantly higher than pREE at all time points with the mREE/pREE ratio elevated at time point 1:118% ± 19.5%; time point 2: 112% ± 13.2%; and time point 3: 122 ± 14.3%. CONCLUSION: The mREE remained stable during CFPEx and clinical stability. The pREE underestimated mREE and application of injury factor adjustment of 110% to 130% could potentially account for this discrepancy. The potential role of IC and body composition in individualizing CF nutritional assessment and prescription requires further exploration.},

In the CFG, 43% were severely/mildly dehydrated, while none were in the CG (P =.007). In the CFG, there was an association between high nutrition risk - via nutrition screening (odds ratio [OR], 22.28; P <.05), lower values of anthropometric parameters, higher z-resistance/height (OR, 2.23; P <.05) and z-reactance/height (OR, 1.81; P <.05), and dehydration (OR, 4.94; P <.05) - and lung function impairment. Conclusions: The CFG exhibited a compromised nutrition status assessed by anthropometric and BIA parameters. Nutrition screening, anthropometric and BIA parameters, and hydration status were associated with lung function.},

abstract = {Background: Ivacaftor, a potentiating agent has been shown to improve weight and BMI in patients with at least one copy of CFTR-G551D mutation. Effects on body composition are less well reported. Objectives: To evaluate changes in body composition following ivacaftor therapy. Methods: Twenty patients were included in a placebo-controlled crossover study of ivacaftor (28day treatment period), with 3 month open label extension. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was conducted to measure weight, fat mass (FM), fat free mass (FFM), skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and total body water (TBW). Results: Weight significantly increased above baseline at 1 month and post 3 months of ivacaftor treatment. FFM, SMM and TBW significantly increased following 1 month. FM did not significantly increase with 1 month of ivacaftor treatment but increased significantly above baseline post 3 months. (Table Presented) Conclusion: The significant increase in weight is comparable to other seminal papers. The increase in FFM and SMM in the first 28days reflects an increase in TBW. Increase in FM did not occur until after 1month of treatment. These changes impact on nutrition practice. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate body composition with ivacaftor treatment using the BIA method. Validation with DEXA is underway.},

abstract = {Rationale While lung transplantation is a life-saving procedure for many adults with advanced lung disease, the risk of death in the first year after transplantation remains unacceptably high. There is an unmet need for novel, precisely measured extrapulmonary measures of peri-operative risk that might aid in the prediction of post-operative complications. We hypothesize that sarcopenia (low skeletal muscle mass) and skeletal muscle function may be unrecognized extrapulmonary predictors of poor outcomes following lung transplantation. Methods Adult lung transplant candidates at Columbia University Medical Center were enrolled in a prospective cohort study that included body composition assessment by bioelectrical impedance analysis and grip strength assessment. Skeletal muscle mass was estimated from age, gender, height, and impedance and normalized to height-squared (skeletal muscle mass index, SMI). Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI below the lower limit of normal (9.12 kg/m2 for men and 6.53 kg/m2 for women) using NHANES III reference values. Grip strength was measured using a hand-held Jamar dynamometer. Non-parametric statistics were used. Results 64 adult lung transplant candidates completed assessments. The mean age was 56 yrs (range 25-71 yrs), 20% were over age 65, 48% were men, 73% were non-Hispanic white, 56% had interstitial lung disease (ILD), 22% had emphysema, 11% had cystic fibrosis, and 15 (23%) were sarcopenic. Sarcopenic candidates tended to be older (63 vs 54 yrs, p = 0.001), non-Hispanic white (47% vs 24%, p = 0.12), have ILD (80% vs 49%, p = 0.03), and have a lower body mass index (24 vs 26 kg/m2, p = 0.12). To date, 16 have undergone lung transplantation, of whom 6 (38%) were sarcopenic. Sarcopenic transplant recipients had higher oxygen requirements (8 vs 5 L/min, p = 0.11), higher LAS (59 vs 47, p = 0.14), and lower mean pulmonary artery pressure (16 vs 28, p = 0.03) than non-sarcopenic recipients. SMI was positively correlated with FVC% (0.50, p = 0.049). Lower grip strength was associated with a higher LAS (r = -61, p = 0.01), lower six-minute walk distance (r= 0.57, p = 0.02), fewer ICU-free days (r = 0.58, p = 0.02), and fewer ventilator-free days (r = 0.43, p = 0.09). Conclusions Sarcopenia is prevalent among lung transplant candidates. Reduced grip strength, a measure of skeletal muscle function, may be associated with poor outcomes after lung transplantation.},

abstract = {Introduction: Structural abnormalities in the Cystic fbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein causes clinical symptoms in several organs and organ systems in patients with cystic fbrosis (CF), which mainly include respiratory and gastrointestinal changes. As a consequence of these changes, patients with CF usually display nutrient malabsorption, low-caloric intake, and increased energy expenditures. This results in a signifcant nutritional impairment. Respiratory exacerbations frequently occur in these patients, and many require hospital admission, which risks nutritional deterioration.Several treatment strategies have been offered to improve pulmonary and nutritional status. With respect to nutritional therapy during hospitalization, there is a consensus that patients should receive a hypercaloric diet with adequate replacement of pancreatic enzymes. Energy supplements should also be used to facilitate weight gainIntervention studies suggest that the accumulation of lean mass is associated with the preservation of lung function in CF patients. Meanwhile, the loss of lean mass has been associated with increased severity of the disease, decreased lung function, respiratory muscle weakness, and increased systemic infammation. Therefore, aggressive nutritional support aims to achieve normal growth patterns and should lead to the maintenance of lung function. However, there is a paucity of evidence evaluating the effectiveness of the nutritional therapy recommended to inpatients. The few studies that evaluated weight gain included a limited number of participants a large age group, and it did not assess weight gain with an emphasis on body mass change as the main outcome. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the variations in body weight and composition by means of electric bioimpedance in children and adolescents diagnosed with cystic fbrosis. These patients received a high-calorie diet during hospitalization for pulmonary exacerbation. Materials/Methods: This was a longitudinal study involving children and adolescents with cystic fbrosis, who were being followed up by the Multidisciplinary Cystic Fibrosis Team at S{\~{a}}o Lucas Hospital of PUCRS in Porto Alegre, Brazil. We included patients with a confrmed diagnosis of CF, who underwent hospital admission because of pulmonary exacerbation. The nutritional evaluation of the patients occurred at two timepoints: once during the frst 24 hours of hospitalization and again 24 hours before discharge. In each case, weight and height were measured after an electrical bioimpedance analysis. The caloric intake was evaluated by describing the foods consumed using a food registry for 3 consecutive days from day 7 of hospitalizationPulmonary function tests were performed at the time of the initial hospitalization by individuals trained according with the American Thoracic Society standards. The spirometry parameters were evaluated also. Results: The sample consisted of 23 patients. Of these 10/23 (43.4%) were male. The mean age was 11.9 ± 3.8 years, and 9/23 (39.0%) had undergone gastrostomy. The mean length of hospital stay was 12.9 ± 3.9 days. The patients had in average moderate pulmonary compromise according to the ATS ERS classifcation. The results of dietary intake showed that food consumption was categorized as a hypercaloric diet. Tables shows variations in the anthropometric parameters and body composition variables. These fndings showed that there was a signifcant change in the means of the following variables in the patients: weight, BMI (z-score), percentage of lean mass, and percentage of fat mass. Discussion: We found that during the hospital stay, a hypercaloric diet correlated with a signifcant increase in weight, BMI, and the percentage of fat mass. Meanwhile, this diet correlated with a decrease in the percentage of lean mass.It is possible that the signifcant gain in BMI weight and z-scores in the patients resulted from a greater caloric intake and the restriction in physical activity during hospitalization. The observed decrease in lean mass and the increase in fat mass illustrate the importance of reviewing nutritional interventions in patients during hospitalization. The increase in fat mass and the loss of lean mass in patients with adequate nutritional status could cause harm to the health of these individuals.The loss of lean mass may have been associated with the extended time restricted to bed-rest. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining physical activity, even during hospitalization.The results of the present study show the importance of evaluating body composition and tailoring nutritional interventions to CF patients over the course of treatment. Conclusions: In conclusion, a hypercaloric and hyperlipidic diet during hospitalization resulted in signifcant weight gain, a decrease in lean mass, and an increase in the percentage of fat mass in CF patients.},

abstract = {Purpose: Progressive or severe malnutrition is a relative contraindication to lung transplant (LTx). The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) developed new criteria for malnutrition incorporating low muscle mass, relevant due to its high prevalence in severe lung disease. Objective is to compare the prevalence of malnutrition in adults assessed for LTx using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10-AM) criteria against GLIM criteria1. Methods: Retrospective medical record analysis of adults assessed for LTx Sep 2018-Aug 2019. Weight history from dietitian assessment. Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) from physiotherapy assessment. Body Mass Index (BMI) and Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI) from Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis. BMI classification: underweight <18.5kg/m2, normal 18.5-24.9kg/m2, overweight 25.0-29.9kg/m2 and obese >30kg/m2. Criteria for malnutrition using ICD-10-AM: BMI <18.5kg/m2 or unintentional weight loss (moderate 5-9%, severe ≥10%) with reduced food intake. Criteria for malnutrition using GLIM: low BMI or low FFMI (males <17kg/m2, females <15kg/m2) or unintentional weight loss; plus reduced food intake and/or acute or chronic disease1. Results: Of 130 patients assessed, 112 had all data for malnutrition classification [54% male; mean±SD age 54.5±13.8yrs; BMI 24.6±4.0kg/m2; 6MWT 334±119m]. Primary lung disease: ILD 38%, COPD 34%, Cystic Fibrosis 11%, re-transplant 9%, other 8%. BMI: underweight 7%, normal 44%, overweight 43%, obese 6%. FFMI in males was greater than females (17.4±1.8kg/m2 vs 14.3±1.8kg/m2, P <0.0001). Using ICD-10-AM, 26% were malnourished, of whom 28% were severe. Using GLIM, 59% were malnourished, 15% of these severe. Greater diagnosis using GLIM due to high prevalence of low FFMI (females 61% vs males 36%, p=0.009). Of those malnourished using GLIM, 58% would be missed using ICD-10-AM. A third (32%) of those malnourished using GLIM had a BMI >25kg/m2. Malnutrition was most common in COPD (79%) and re-transplant (70%), but there was no association with age or 6MWT. Conclusion: Use of GLIM improves detection of malnutrition, permitting more targeted nutrition interventions. Malnutrition in LTx candidates is seen across all BMI categories. Future studies are needed to investigate GLIM and LTx outcomes.1Jensen GA et al; JPEN 2019; 43:32-40.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the measurement of total body water (TBW) by deuterium (2H2O) dilution and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and healthy controls. Thirty-six clinically stable patients with CF (age 25.4 ± 5.6 yrs) and 42 healthy controls (age 25.4 ± 4.8) were recruited into this study. TBW was measured by 2H2O dilution and predicted by BIA in patients and controls. The TBW predicted from BIA was significantly different from TBW as measured using 2H2O in patients (P < 0.05) but not in controls. Mean (±SD) values for predicted and measured TBW differed by 5.6 (±9.1) L in patients and 0.4 (±3.6)L in controls. This bias was consistent for all controls but not for patients. In CF, BIA over predicted TBW determined by 2H2O dilution to an increasing extent at larger TBW volumes. There was a strong correlation between height2/impedance and TBW in patients with CF (r = 0.90; y = 0.67x + 2.50) and in controls (r = 0.81; y = 0.57x + 9.60). The slope of the regression lines was similar for both groups, however the y intercepts were significantly different (P < 0.05). BIA overestimates TBW in patients with CF, possibly due to invalid factory installed regression equations within BIA instrumentation. Future studies employing BIA as a measure of TBW or FFM in CF should use alternative predictive equations to those that have been developed for healthy individuals. A large scale study to develop specific regression equations for use in CF is warranted.},

abstract = {Objective: Nutritional status, evaluated by BMI, is a major issue in cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a physical retraining (PR) program on body composition assessed by bioimpedancemetry. Methods: A PR 8 week program consisted of 3 weekly sessions including aerobic training (≥ 30 min), muscle strengthening with a circuit training and relaxation individually adapted each week. The evaluations were done before and after PR: a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and quadriceps isometric strength. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (Biacorpus RX4000,) assessed fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM) and body cell mass (BCM). Brachial circumference and triceps skinfold were also measured. The same evaluation were performed at the same interval in a control group of 24 patients. Results: 28 patients aged 28 ± 5 years (FEV1 48.8 ± 19%) were included. There was no significant change in FEV1. After PR, patients improved exercise tolerance and muscle strength. Whereas BMI did not improve, we observed a significant increase of FFM and a trend for BCM. There was no significant change of FM, brachial circumference and triceps fold. There was no significant change in all measurements in controls. There was no correlation between improvement of FFM and improvement of 6MWTdistance or muscle strength. (Table Presented) Conclusion: While BMI was not modified, there was a significant improvement in FFM, illustrating the need to use bioimpedancemetry, making it more accurate than with simple BMI for changes in body composition. In this context PR is of importance not only to improve exercise tolerance but also the nutritional status.},

abstract = {Background: Body mass index is a clinical outcome parameter for the evaluation of the nutritional status in CF. However, recent studies indicate that lean body mass (LBM) might be a stronger indicator. In the nutritional management of CF, tube feeding (TF) is often used to improve the nutritional status. The influence of TF on body composition was not yet evaluated. Method: Bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurements were performed in CF patients with TF (2F, 7M) and without TF (matched controls, Co). Percent fat, body fat mass index (BFMI) and fat free mass index (FFMI) were calculated. Patients were matched for age, gender, pancreatic function. Results are given as median (quartiles). Results: At the start of TF patients were aged 12.8 years (8.7 15.6), had a height z-score of-2.7 (-2.8-1.7) and a BMI z-score of-2.1 (-2.9;-1.4). The median time they were on TF before the BIA measurement was 1.5 years (0.84 2.7). There was a significant improvement in BMI z-score (p= 0.038) and L z score (p=0.008). The age at BIA measurement was 14.4 years (12.5 16.5). TF patients were significantly shorter than Co (p=0.001) but the BMI z-score as well as pulmonary function (FEV1%, FVC%) were not significantly different between TF and Co. The body composition, however, was significantly different with a higher percent fat (p=0.024) (TF: 24.7 (19.6 33.1) and Co: 12.9 (10.8; 22.1)), a higher BFMI (p= 0.019) (TF: 4 (3.3 5.7) Co: 2.5 (1.95 3.85)), and a lower FFMI (p= 0.04) (TF: 11.8 (10.9;13.4) Co 15.1 (13.2;17.25) in TF patients. There was no relation of body composition with age at start of TF, duration of TF or pulmonary function. The BMI z-score at start of TF was positively correlated with percent fat (p=0.032) and BFMI (p=0.01). Conclusion: Patients receiving TF have less FFM. Although tube feeding is often the only remaining way to restore nutritional status in CF patients, it leads to an increase in body fat. Different TF types as well as interventions combining activity to TF should be evaluated in the future.},

abstract = {Objectives: Different studies have shown cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators' impact on nutritional status (NS), which is associated with lung function and exercise tolerance in cystic fibrosis (CF). The aim of our research is to assess anthropometric parameters and body composition changes after Kaftrio{\textregistered} introduction. Methods: 17 patients (pts) >12 years underwent nutritional assessment before (T0) and after three months (T1) of treatment with Kaftrio{\textregistered}. Body mass index (BMI) or BMI percentiles, according to age as stated by guidelines, bioimpedance analysis (BIA) of fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) and hand grip strength (HGS) were considered. Wilcoxon signedrank test and McNemar test were used for continuous and categorical variables, respectively, considering as significant a p-values <0.05. The SAS software was used. Results: The sample included 17 pts (14 female) with median age 18 (range 12–22.9); 16 had exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Number of pts with normal NS increased from 5/17 (29%) at T0 to 9/17 (53%) at T1 with statistical significance (p = 0.046). FM and FFM both increased from T0 to T1 (median value increased from 10.9 to 11.7 kg and from 37.8 to 38.9 kg respectively) with statistical significance (p = 0.04 and p = 0.0002). FM% change was not statistically significant (p = 0.7). HGS increased from 18.1 to 22 kg (21.5%) without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.1). Conclusion: Treatment with Kaftrio{\textregistered} seems to improve NS. BIA provides information about body composition which can be useful for nutritional assessment. FM has increased as well as FFM with an improvement in muscular function (HGS) though without statistical significance in the short term. These findings confirm the important impact of CFTR modulators on the course of CF and, in particular, on various markers of NS. Outcomes will be assessed in the long term and more patients will be enrolled in the study.},

abstract = {Objectives and Study: Myoglobin is a hemoprotein expressed principally in the striated muscle and to a lesser extent in glandular tissues. Serum myoglobin permits the assessment of low-grade muscle damage, such as found in dystrophia or following physical exertion. In cystic fibrosis (CF) the evidence for a specific CFTR-dependent muscular dysfunction is conflicting. We aimed to measure myoglobin in CF for the first time and hypothesized that: (1) serum myoglobin is elevated and (2) associates with clinical factors. Methods: We performed our study within a broader project focused on atherogenesis in CF (AtheroCF). The following clinical information was gathered: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%), body mass index (BMI), exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, CF-related diabetes, CF-related liver disease, and chronic or recurrent Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. Fat-free mass (FFM) was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The concentration of myoglobin in the serum was measured using ELISA (the upper limit of normal: 85 ng/mL). We used the following statistical tools: the Mann-Whitney U test, the Fisher's test (two-tailed p), Spearman's rank-sum correlation coefficient ($\rho$) and forward-stepwise linear regression. Results: We enrolled 42 CF patients, of whom half were female, aged 20.4 years [median; 1st-3rd quartile: 18.4-30.2]. BIA was performed in 31 subjects (74%). Median myoglobin was 109.5 ng/mL [73.0-142.0]; it was elevated in 25 subjects (59.5%). The following were observed in the elevated myoglobin (EM) group as compared with the normal myoglobin (NM) group (n=17): greater body mass 60.0 kg [53.0-66.8] vs. 47.4 kg [44.0-57.0] (p=0.0067), height 170.0 cm [163.0-174.0] vs. 160.0 cm [154.0-169.0] (p=0.016), and BMI 21.3 kg/m2 [19.1-22.3] vs. 19.3 kg/m2 [17.3-20.4] (p=0.026), as well as FFM 50.6 kg [44.0-57.3] vs. 38.7 kg [35.5-42.7] (p=0.0006). Myoglobin/FFM ratio was higher in EM group: 3.2 [2.2-4.2] vs. 1.7 [1.6-2.0] (p=0.00002); myoglobin/FFM was also increased in CF-related liver disease (p=0.012). EM patients were not older (p=0.11); neither was significantly greater the percentage of males (p=0.06). The two groups did not differ with regard to FEV1% (p=0.47), pancreatic status (p=1.0), diabetes (p=0.74), CF-related liver disease (p=0.75), liver cirrhosis (p=0.68), P. aeruginosa colonization (p=0.76), CFTR class I or II homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations (p=0.12) or C-reactive protein (p=0.72). Myoglobin correlated with: FFM ($\rho$=0.61, p=0.00027), body mass ($\rho$=0.40, p=0.0086), BMI ($\rho$=0.34, p=0.027), as well as height ($\rho$=0.31, p=0.049). Regression analysis for the prediction of myoglobin levels dealt with potential confounders: FFM, body mass, height, BMI, age, sex, and CFTR mutation class (as above). The resulting model (adjusted R2=0.30, p=0.0024) was based on two parameters: FFM ($\beta$=0.90; 95%CI 0.40-1.39) and height ($\beta$=-0.53; 95%CI-1.03-(-0.04)). Conclusion: Over half of CF patients exhibit increased myoglobin concentrations, which mostly relate to greater FFM. Our findings support the notion that CF causes chronic muscle damage.},

abstract = {Objectives: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are at nutritional risk. In addition to the lung pathology, one of the main pathologic issues is viscous mucus blocking pancreatic ducts, leading to reduced production of pancreatic enzymes. Therefore, maldigestion and consequently malabsorption occurs, particularly of fats and liposoluble vitamins, resulting in steatorrhea, vitamin deficiencies and subsequently malnutrition. We aimed to determine the prevalence of malnutrition and investigate the nutritional status of an adult Swiss CF cohort. Methods: We contrasted CF patients with healthy controls regarding nutritional status and dietary habits in an observational cohort study. Assessment was based on nutritional risk screening (NRS-2002), dietary habits (7-day diet record), body composition (bioelectric impedance analysis, anthropometrics), resting energy expenditure (REE; indirect calorimetry), and physical/mental function (hand grip strength, SF-36v2{\textregistered}). Results: Nineteen patients (15 men, median age 3y) and 15 controls (8 men, median age 52y) were included. Eight patients (42%) were at nutritional risk (NRS-2002 ≥ 3). According to ESPEN guidelines, 8 (42%) patients were malnourished. Energy intake per kg body weight was significantly higher in patients (p =.021). No significant differences arose in REE (p =.451) and estimated energy requirements (p =.202). Energy balance is + 648 kcal/day in patients and + 57 kcal/day in controls (p =.121). Patients had significantly lower BMI (p =.030), body fat percentage (p <.001), and physical/mental health scores (p <.001) than controls. Conclusion: Malnutrition is highly prevalent in this CF cohort. Energy intake and body weight are highly discrepant in this population. In clinical practice, energy requirements of CF patients add up to approximately twice the Harris-Benedict estimation and 1.7 times indirect calorimetry REE. An adequate intake of pancreatic enzyme substitution is crucial indeed.},

abstract = {This pilot study compared the use of bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA), a rapid, portable, and painless method of measuring body composition, to isotope dilution in patients with and without cystic fibrosis (CF). Many methods exist for measuring body composition but these measures can be difficult to use in the clinical setting. BIA has been validated as a tool for nutritional assessment in healthy adults, but it must be validated in patient populations with specific disease-related nutritional problems, such as CF. Ten ambulatory patients with CF were selected along with ten controls matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI; wt/ht2). Total body water (TBW) was determined using isotope-ratio mass spectrometry on urine specimens before and after patients consumed 0.2 g/kg deuterium-rich water. BIA was performed using a tetrapolar technique; 500 $\mu$A of current at 50 kHz was introduced and the voltage drop measured. Seven men and three women were studied in each group. Median age was 27 (range, 18-39) and median BMI was 19.2 (range, 16.7-30.1) in CF adults. Median age was 27.5 (range, 15-43) and median BMI was 20.7 (range, 19.4-31.6) in controls. The resistance index (RI; ht2/resistance) correlated strongly with TBW in patients with CF (r = 0.88; y = 0.482x + 11.138; p < 0.05) as well as in controls (r = 0.87; y = 0.661x + 1.299; p < 0.05). We conclude that BIA is a rapid, portable, and painless method for measuring body composition that correlates well with the deuterium-dilution method. However, CF-specific regression equations will need to be developed and confidence intervals defined using large numbers of patients before this technique can be widely applied to patients with CF.},

abstract = {Objectives: To analyse the prevalence of malnutrition in candidates for lung transplantation and to establish if there are any differences in the prevalence of malnutrition among the different groups of patients regarding their illness. Methods: We reviewed the nutritional evaluation of 163 consecutive transplant candidates referred to our hospital (1996-2001). The nutritional assessment included: clinical history, anthropometric measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and biochemical measurements. The nutritional status diagnosis was determined following RWS Chang protocol. Results: 163 patients (108 male/55 female; 42,9 ± 14,7 yr.) agrupped into four main lung diseases groups: obstructive (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease): 60 (36,8%); interstitial (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis): 45 (27,6%); septic (cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis): 47 (28,8%); and vascular (primary pulmonary hypertension and miscellaneous etiology): 11 (6,7%). The prevalence of malnutrition is 60,9% (IC 95%; 53,4-68,4) and the most prevalent type is moderate caloric malnutrition (23,3%). Percentaje of triceps skinfold trickness was lower in the septic group (65,1 ± 43,0) than in the obstructive (94,8 ± 53,9; p < 0,05) or in the interstitial one (130,3 ± 61,5; p < 0,0001). Interstitial group had also the higher weight, BMI and percentaje of ideal weight. Percentaje of arm muscle circumference was only different between interstitial and septic groups (105,5 ± 18,3 vs 95,9 ± 11,1; p < 0,01). Resting energy expenditure was lower in septic patients. This group had lower levels of prealbumin than obstructive (17,6 ± 4,7 vs 24,4 ± 4,8 mg/dl; p < 0,0001) or interstitial groups (17,6 ± 4,7 vs 27,3 ± 7,7 mg/dl; p < 0,0001). Conclusions: Malnutrition in patients awaiting lung transplantation is highly prevalent, specially in septic and vascular lung diseases. Anthropometric measurements are a good and easy option to explore this problem. Nutritional rehabilitation of these patients could improve their postoperative course.},

abstract = {Ivacaftor is associated with weight gain, including fat mass gain in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with the CFTR-G551D mutation (1). Lumacaftor- ivacaftor is associated with reduced hospitalisation and intravenous antibiotic use, but its impact on body composition is not yet widely studied. This is particularly important in severe lung disease, as low FEV1% is associated with low body mass index (BMI) and fat-free mass (FFM) depletion. Aim: To evaluate changes in body composition in adults with CF with FEV1<40% predicted over the first six months of treatment with lumacaftor- ivacaftor. Methods: Data were analysed on 20 adults with CF (10 female, mean±SD age 34.1±8.9 years, baseline mean±SD FEV1 33.3±6.1%predicted, mean±SD BMI 19.8±2.2kg/m2), who received lumacaftor-ivacaftor for six months, and had body composition measured using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (mBCA, SECA, Germany) at baseline and 6 months. Changes($\Delta$) in weight, total body water (TBW), extra- and intra-cellular water (ECW, ICW), FFM and fat mass (FM) were determined. ICW reflects body cell mass (BCM). Paired t-tests, Pearson's correlations and multiple regression were undertaken. Results: At six months, mean weight and fat mass significantly increased: (2.2±3.9kg (p=0.02) and 2.1±2.6kg (p=0.02) respectively). No significant changes were observed in FFM (mean ±SD change +0.5±2.3kg), TBW (+0.4±1.7kg), ECW (0±0.7kg) or ICW (+0.4±1.2kg). There was wide variation in body composition changes: four patients gained ≥2kg FFM while three lost ≥2kg FFM. Ten patients gained ≥2kg FM. Gender, age and baseline FEV1% were not associated with body composition changes. Lower baseline BMI was correlated with greater gains in weight (r= -0.60, p=0.005) and FFM (r= -0.46, p=0.04). Of the seven adults with BMI<18.5kg/m2 at baseline, only one remained below BMI 18.5kg/m2 at six months. In multiple regression, $\Delta$fat mass(p<0.0001) and $\Delta$ICW(p=0.002), but not $\Delta$ECW, were significant predictors of $\Delta$weight. Conclusions: Weight gain was observed following six months of lumacaftor- ivacaftor treatment. However, there was a variable body composition response with 20% of adults achieving clinically important gains in FFM, and half gaining fat mass. Monitoring body composition permits more specific evaluation of the tissue composition of weight changes in CF patients on ivacaftor-lumacaftor. The independent association of change in ICW, but not ECW, with weight changes suggests that increases in BCM, rather than in extravascular fluid retention, explains changes in FFM. The mechanisms underlying body composition changes require further investigation, including mediation via improved exercise tolerance and/or appetite and amelioration of catabolism related to reduced exacerbations.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to measure whole-body bioelectrical variables and to validate the technique of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as a measure of total body water (TBW) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). In 20 normally nourished males with CF, aged 7 to 39 years, bioelectrical impedance measurements were compared with TBW measured by isotopic distribution of H218O. The relationship between the two measurements was found to be highly significant (r = 0.96; p < 0.0001). The major genotype mutation $\Delta$F508 was found to have no effect on BIA. Comparison of the CF patients with 21 normal controls matched for age and TBW volumes as measured by H218O volume of distribution showed no difference in electrical parameters. However, the slope of the regression lines (H218O, H2/R) was significantly steeper for the CF subjects (p < 0.03) than for controls. These data show that BIA can be used to measure TBW in patients with CF. However, the predictive equations developed in healthy control subjects should not be used; rather, separate predictive equations for patients with CF will need to be developed.},

The limits of agreement procedure was used to determine the reliability and precision of the different techniques to predict values for TBK, in an individual subject.

Therefore, maldigestion and consequently malabsorption (particularly fat and fat-soluble vitamins) occur, resulting in steatorrhea, vitamin deficiencies, and subsequently manifest malnutrition. The aim of this study was to investigate the nutritional status and determine the prevalence of malnutrition in an adult Swiss CF cohort. Methods: This was an observational cohort study in which the nutritional status and dietary habits of patients with CF and healthy controls were compared. Assessment was based on the nutritional risk screening (NRS-2002), dietary habits (7-d dietary record), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis), anthropometrics, resting energy expenditure (REE; indirect calorimetry), and physical or mental function (hand-grip strength, Short Form-36 v2). Results: Nineteen patients (15 men, mean age 32 y) and 15 controls (8 men, mean age 49 y) were included. Eight patients (42%) were at nutritional risk (NRS-2002 ≥3). Patients had higher energy intake/body weight (P = 0.021) with lower body fat percentage (P < .001), body mass index (P = 0.030), and physical/mental health scores (P < 0.001) than controls. Energy intake was higher than REE in patients (P = 0.003), but not in controls (P = 0.373). Conclusions: Prevalence of malnutrition was high in this CF cohort, coinciding with low body fat percentage and low body mass index despite high energy and protein intake. Energy requirements of patients with CF should be estimated as approximately twice the Harris–Benedict REE and 1.7 times indirect calorimetry REE, while ensuring adequate intake of pancreatic enzymes.},

Inclusion criteria were age between 4 and 18 years, diagnosis of CF, and the attendance of a caregiver in patients younger than 14 years. A questionnaire was applied to assess sociodemographic data and nutritional status. HRQoL was evaluated using the Portuguese revised version of the CF questionnaire (CFQ-R). Spearman correlations were calculated to analyze the agreement between children's and parents' reports. Spearman correlations and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to identify associations between HRQoL domains and determinants.Results:The scores of CFQ-R domains were high, with the lowest median value being 66.67. It was found positive moderate associations between children's and parents' reports in 3 domains (P <.05): eating disturbances, body image, and respiratory symptoms. The median scores were similar in the eating disturbances (approximately 80.00) and in the respiratory symptoms (83.33). However, there is a consistent difference of 14.07 in the body image domain. Current age, physical activity, and iron were positively associated with HRQoL, whereas age at diagnosis was negatively associated.Conclusion:These findings reinforce the importance to evaluate HRQoL during childhood and adolescence and to invest in this public health theme.},

The aim, of the study was to determine the correlation between supplemented vitamin A and E levels and clinical status. Material and methods: The study comprised 52 CF patients. In all patients, serum $\alpha$-tocopherol and retinol levels were measured. The nutritional status (body height and weight, bioimpedance analysis of body components) and clinical expression of the disease (lung function and exocrine pancreatic function) were also assessed. Results: the levels of $\alpha$-tocopherol (028±0.20 mg/dL) were significantly lower than reference values, which was not the case for retinol (43.8±10.2 $\mu$g/dL). The existence of a statistically significant correlation between serum $\alpha$-tocopherol and fecal elastase-1 (p < 0.02) was found. Standardized body weight also correlated with $\alpha$-tocopherol levels (p < 0.05). No correlations between serum retinol and clinical parameters were found. Conclusion: Current fat-soluble vitamin supplementation provides normal retinal concentrations. However, $\alpha$-tocopherol levels demand thorough follow-up.

abstract = {Objectives and Study: Cystic fibrosis (CF)-related chronic inflammation, dyslipidemia, and fat-soluble nutrient deficiency may promote atherogenesis. We hypothesized that quality intima-media thickness (QIMT)-a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis not yet investigated in CF-and arterial stiffness are increased in CF and may be related to several factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study builds on the AtheroCF project. Carotid radio frequency QIMT was assessed ultrasonographically. Arterial stiffness was determined employing pulse wave analysis by radial artery applanation tonometry. Body mass index, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%), status of the exocrine pancreas, CFTR genotype, C-reactive protein (CRP), and other basic characteristics were determined in CF patients. Additional analyses included: fatty acid profile of serum glycerophospholipids (method by Glaser et al.), cholesterol fractions and triglycerides, and body composition by the means of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Results: Fifty-six CF patients at a median age of 23.8 years [1st-3rd quartile 18.8-33.1] enrolled for the study along with 51 healthy subjects (HS; 24.1 years [20.3-30.3]; BMI 21.6 kg/m2 [19.9-23.4]). Patients' median BMI was 20.3 [17.7-22.0], FEV1% 63.5% [41.2-84.0]; 78.6% were pancreatic insufficient (PI), 48.2% harbored homozygous or compound heterozygous class I or II CFTR mutations. QIMT did not differ between CF patients (n=41) and HS (n=48): 477 $\mu$m [412-531] vs. 451 $\mu$m [406-505], p=0.232 (Mann-Whitney U test). However, arterial stiffness was significantly greater in CF (n=52) than in HS (n=48): 6.56 m/s [5.67-7.86] vs. 5.76 m/s [5.28-6.36], p=0.001. QIMT was thicker in pancreatic sufficient (PS) than in PI patients (n=11 vs n=30): 542 $\mu$m [529-593] vs 456 $\mu$m [390-490], p=0.0002. It was also greater in PS than in HS (p=0.001). QIMT correlated with age ($\rho$=0.44, p=0.004). Arterial stiffness was lower in PS than PI (n=40): 5.85 m/s [5.22-6.31] vs. 6.87 m/s [5.81-8.02], p=0.023. In the PS subgroup it was similar to HS (p=0.964). The stiffness in CF negatively correlated with FEV1% ($\rho$=-0.46, p=0.0006), and positively with both age ($\rho$=0.43, p=0.002) and CRP ($\rho$=0.39, p=0.004). In CF patients we found no remarkable links between arterial stiffness or QIMT and individual fatty acids, their proportions or fat-free mass in BIA. A forward stepwise regression including age, sex, BMI, FEV1%, and pancreatic status suggested that only age and PI were independently linked with greater arterial stiffness in CF. On the other hand, in a similar test thicker QIMT associated with PS alone. QIMT did not correlate with arterial stiffness. Conclusion: CF patients' cardiovascular health seems to be at risk of two different natures. While PS subjects have thicker QIMT, PI patients present greater arterial stiffness. Moreover, both QIMT and arterial stiffness increase with age. The clinical relevance of these findings is yet to be determined.},

abstract = {Background: Muscle ultrasonography of the quadriceps rectus femoris (QRF) is a technique on the rise in the assessment of muscle mass in application of nutritional assessment. The aim of the present study is to assess the usefulness of muscle ultrasonography in patients with cystic fibrosis, comparing the results with other body composition techniques such as anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and handgrip strength (HGS). At the same time, we intend to assess the possible association with the nutritional and respiratory status. Methods: This was a prospective observational study in adult patients with cystic fibrosis in a clinically stable situation. Muscle ultrasonography of the QRF was performed, and the results were compared with other measures of body composition: anthropometry, BIA, and DXA. HGS was used to assess muscle function. Respiratory parameters were collected, and nutritional status was assessed using Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. Results: A total of 48 patients were included, with a mean age of 34.1 ± 8.8 years. In total, 24 patients were men, and 24 patients were women. Mean BMI was 22.5 ± 3.8 kg/m2. Mean muscular area rectus anterior (MARA) was 4.09 ± 1.5 cm2, and mean muscular circumference rectus was 8.86 ± 1.61 cm. A positive correlation was observed between the MARA and fat-free mass index (FFMI) determined by anthropometry (r = 0.747; p < 0.001), BIA (r = 0.780; p < 0.001), and DXA (r = 0.678; p < 0.001), as well as muscle function (HGS: r = 0.790; p < 0.001) and respiratory parameters (FEV1; r = 0.445, p = 0.005; FVC: r = 0.376, p = 0.02; FEV1/FVC: r = 0.344, p = 0.037). A total of 25 patients (52.1%) were diagnosed with malnutrition according to GLIM criteria. Differences were observed when comparing the MARA based on the diagnosis of malnutrition (4.75 ± 1.65 cm2 in normo-nourished vs. 3.37 ± 1.04 in malnourished; p = 0.014). Conclusions: In adults with cystic fibrosis, the measurements collected by muscle ultrasound of the QRF correlate adequately with body composition techniques such as anthropometry, BIA, DXA, and handgrip strength. Muscle ultrasound measurements, particularly the MARA, are related to the nutritional status and respiratory function of these patients.},

abstract = {Aim: We aimed to compare functional capacity, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, and body composition in patients with cystic fibrosis, non-cystic bronchiectasis and healthy controls. Methods: 43 with bronchiectasis, 36 patients with cystic fibrosis, and 35 age-sex matched controls were included. Body composition was evaluated using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Pulmonary function test was performed. Respiratory muscle strength (MIP and MEP) was evaluated using a mouth pressure device, quadriceps muscle strength using a dynamometer, functional capacity using six-minute walk test (6MWT). Results: The weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and fat free mass, pulmonary functions, MIP and MEP, quadriceps muscle strength, 6MWT distance, were significantly lower in patients with bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis compared with healthy controls (p<0.05). 24 patients (56%) with bronchiectasis, 23 (64%) patients with cystic fibrosis had malnutrition. 12 (28%) bronchiectasis, 16 (44%) cystic fibrosis patients' MIP were weaker than 95%CI (80-150 cmH2O) of the controls. 8 (19%) bronchiectasis, 8 (22%) cystic fibrosis patients' 6MWT distance were shorter than 95%CI (576-871 m) of the controls. 9 (21%) bronchiectasis, 7 (19%) cystic fibrosis patients' quadriceps muscle were weaker than 95%CI (160- 500 N) of the controls. Conclusion: Body composition, pulmonary function, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength and functional capacity are impaired in bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis patients. Malnutrition may lead these impairments. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs should be adjusted to improve these outcomes.},

abstract = {Background/Purpose: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and incident fracture. Factors associated with prevalent and progressive bone deficits in adults with CF have not been comprehensively studied. This study assessed the independent predictors of baseline bone mineral density (BMD) and 2-year changes BMD in adults with CF. Methods: Sixty-four adult patients with CF, ages 18-57, were recruited from the Massachusetts General Hospital Cystic Fibrosis Care Center. Dual energy absorptometry (DXA) was performed at the spine and radius at baseline and 2-years. Estimates of fat-free mass index (FFMI) and fat mass index (FMI) were determined using height, weight, and tetrapolar bioelectric impedance analysis. All subjects underwent lung spirometry within 1 month of the study visit to measure forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume (FEV1). Linear regression models evaluated predictors of baseline BMD Z-scores and change in anterior-posterior (AP) spine BMD Z-score over the 2-year follow-up. Osteopenia was defined as a BMD Z-score of 2-1.0. Results: Osteopenia was present in 52% of subjects. Compared to patients without osteopenia, subjects with osteopenia were more likely to be male (67% v. 32%, p=0.009), more likely to be current users of glucocorticoids (21% v. 0%, p<0.001), had lower percent body fat (19% v. 23%, p=0.04), and were more likely to have had a previous fracture (60% v. 46%, p=0.007). In multivariable models, greater estimated FFMI and greater height, but not greater FMI, were associated with greater BMD after adjusting for sex (Table 1). Low FVC and greater adiposity were associated with greater loss of BMD at the A/P spine over two years (p<0.05) (Table 2). Conclusion: Male sex, short stature, and low lean mass at baseline are associated with low BMD among adults with CF. Greater adiposity and lower lung function in women are predictors of negative change in BMD Z-score at the A/P spine at 2-years of follow-up. (Figure Presented).},

We performed bioelectrical impedance analysis using multi frequency a whole-body bioelectrical impedance analyser, Tanita MC 780 MA, (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo-Japan). At annual assessment absolute FEV1, weight, height, phase angle, body fat percentage and fat free mass were measured. Fat free mass and total body weight were divided by the square of height for each participant to determine BMI and fat free mass index. Results: One hundred and twenty-four sets of data were available from 103 patients. There was a positive weak correlation between absolute FEV1 and BMI (r = 0.19, p = 0.032). Absolute FEV1 was positively correlated with fat free mass index (r = 0.34, p < 0.001) and phase angle (r = 0.34, p < 0.001). Phase angle strongly and positively correlated with fat free mass (r = 0.69, p < 0.001) and fat free mass index (r = 0.69, p = <0.001), whilst it was negatively correlated with body fat percentage (r = −0.33, p = <0.001). Phase angle was also positively correlated with absolute FEV1 (r = 0.33, p = <0.001). Conclusion: BMI as a marker of nutritional status is associated with pulmonary function in people with CF, yet in this data set the correlation for absolute FEV1 and BMI was weaker than for absolute FEV1 and fat free mass index and phase angle. Moreover, a strong correlation for phase angle is of interest especially as a prognostic marker as it provides information on cell mass and integrity. These findings may benefit from larger prospective studies to confirm these findings and determine the long-term clinical consequences in CF and phase angle may be better suited due to the assumptions made by bioelectrical impedance analysis equations.},

Absolute FEV1 was negatively associated with body fat percentage (r = 0.2, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Excess adiposity, particularly in the form of normal weight obesity (normal weight BMI with elevated body fat percentage) has been shown to have a negative association with lung function. In this small study we noted higher frequency of normal weight obesity in people with glucose tolerance irregularities.

abstract = {Aim: The study aimed to determine lung function, functional capacity, energy cost, and nutritional status in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with and without inspiratory muscle weakness (IMW). It was also aimed to investigate the relationship between energy cost and lung function, functional capacity, and nutritional status. Methods: Forty-four CF patients (13.70±3.97 yrs, 30M, 24F) participated in this study. Lung function tests and the six-minute walk test (6MWT) were performed. The physiological cost index (PCI) was calculated by the difference between resting heart rate and heart rate at the end of the 6MWT, divided by average velocity (m/min). Nutritional status was evaluated using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength (MIP and MEP, respectively) was measured. Based on MIP, patients were divided into two groups as with and without IMW (<80%, n=19 and >80%, n=25, respectively). Results: There were no significant differences in age, gender, height, weight between the groups (p>0.05). FEV1, PEF, FEF25-75%, 6MWT distance, and fat-free mass index were significantly lower in CF patients with IMW than those without IMW (p<0.05). The PCI was significantly higher in the IMW group (p<0.05). The PCI was related with FFM (r=-0.387, p=0.035), FVC (r=-0.306, p=0.043), and fatigue (r=0.315, p=0.045) in patients with CF. Discussion: The CF patients with IMW show worse lung function, functional capacity, energy cost, and nutritional status. Higher energy cost during submaximal test correlated with nutritional status, fatigue, and forced vital capacity. Preserved inspiratory muscle strength is important in CF.},

abstract = {Introduction: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a disease of autosomal recessive character, chronic and progressive, with involvement oficial various organs and systems. Respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders are more prevalent, which usually results in nutritional deficit. However, when there is a worsening of the clinical condition, requiring hospitalization, the risk of nutritional inbalance increases. The aim of this study was to evaluate variations in weight and body composition during hospitalization of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis who received hypercaloric and hyperlipidic diet during hospitalization. Methods: This is a longitudinal study involving children and adolescents with CF hospitalized at S{\~{a}}o Lucas's Hospital/ PUCRS. Bioimpedance analysis was used to assess body composition. The evaluation took place within 48 hours after admission and 24 hours prior to hospital discharge. The energy and nutrient intake was investigated through a food record during three consecutive days. Comparisons between weight and body composition during hospitalization were performed through the corresponding statistical tests (paired t test). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Results: The sample consisted of 18 patients, 11 (61 %) male. The mean age was 11.7 ± 3. 6 years. The mean hospital stay was 14. 5 ± 3. 75 days. At the beginning of hospitalization, most patients were eutrophic n = 14 (78%). Regarding categorization by pulmonary function, patients had moderate pulmonary disease according to FEV1 (52. 08 ± 22. 2). Patients received hypercaloric and hyperlipidic diet during hospitalization , and the findings showed significant changes in the variables, weight and fat mass (weight = 1. 47 kg , p < 0. 001 and fat mass 0.788 kg, p<0.004).Conclusion : The hypercaloric and hyperlipidic diet recommended during hospitalization was associated with significant weight gain and fat mass, with improvement of the nutritional status of most patients.},

abstract = {Objectives: Maintenance of optimal nutritional status is a crucial issue for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Here, we evaluate the effects of an 8-week exercise training (ET) program on body composition in CF patients. Methods: This prospective pilot observational study was conducted in adult CF subjects in stable condition following their annual check-up. The ET program consisted of three sessions per week and included aerobic training (≥ 30 min), muscle strengthening, circuit training, and relaxation. Exercise tolerance (6-minute walk test, 6MWT), pulmonary function, quadriceps isometric strength, and body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis of fat-free mass [FFM], fat mass, and body cell mass) were analyzed before and immediately after the ET program. A control group of CF patients who preferred not to participate in the ET program received the same evaluations. Results: A total of 43 CF patients were enrolled and offered the ET program; 28 accepted (aged 28 ± 5 years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] 48.8 ± 19% predicted) and 15 declined the ET program but agreed to be part of the control group (matched for age and CF severity: 30.8 ± 9 years, FEV1 51.8 ± 16.5%). Pulmonary function was unchanged at the end of the ET program, but significant improvements were observed in 6MWT distance (from 520 ± 96 m to 562 ± 105 m, P < 0.001) and muscle strength (331 ± 141 N to 379 ± 168 N, P < 0.001). Although mean body mass index did not change, the ET group showed significantly increased FFM (43.85 ± 8 kg to 44.5 ± 9.2 kg, P = 0.03) and a trend towards increased body cell mass (21.4 ± 6 to 22.1 ± 6.6 kg, P = 0.06). All other parameters were unchanged by ET. There were no significant correlations between the increase in FFM and the improvements in either 6MWT distance or muscle strength. The CF control group exhibited no significant changes in any parameters between evaluations. Conclusions: ET significantly improved FFM, but not body mass index, in CF patients. The results illustrate the superiority of bioimpedancemetry for assessing changes in body composition and reveal the importance of ET for improving not only exercise tolerance but also nutritional status in these patients.},

abstract = {This study contrasts body compositions (by six methods) of eight cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects with those of eight control subjects matched for age, height, and sex. CF subjects weighed 84% as much as control subjects. Densitometry and two bioelectrical impedance-analysis methods suggested that reduced CF weights were due to less lean tissue (10.7, 9.5, and 10.4 kg). Total-body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) and skinfold-thickness measurements indicated that CF subjects were leaner than control subjects and had less fat (5.4 and 3.6 kg) and less lean (5.2 and 7 kg) tissue. D2O dilution showed a pattern similar to TOBEC (8.3 kg less lean, 2.7 kg less fat tissue). Densitometry estimates of fat (mass and percent) were not correlated (r < 0.74, p > 0.05) with any other method for CF subjects but were correlated with all other methods for control subjects. CF subjects contained less fat and lean tissue than did control subjects. Densitometry by underwater weighing is unsuitable for assessing body composition of CF patients.},

BIA and phase angle measured at a frequency of 50 kHz between the wrist and contralateral ankle by use of a tetrapolar measuring technique was compared with fat-free mass (FFM) estimated from skin-fold (SK) thickness measurements (n = 57), and body cell mass (grams potassium measured by total-body potassium (TBK) counting. In a subgroup of subjects with end-stage liver disease, BIA was compared with total-body water measured by deuterium dilution (n = 21). High levels of correlation were found in healthy subjects, cystic fibrosis patients, and patients with end-stage liver disease when impedance (height2/resistance) was used to predict TBK (r = 0.96, 0.96, 0.98, respectively), and SK was used to predict FFMs (r = 0.96, 0.99, 0.90, respectively), by linear regression analysis. However, less satisfactory relationships were found when the methods were more appropriately analyzed with an estimated limits of agreement procedure (1 SD = 8.5, 5.0, 27 7% [TBK] and 9.4, 6.7, 23.0% [FFMs], respectively). A poor level of technique agreement (1 SD = 14%) was found when this method was compared with total-body water measured by isotope dilution in patients with liver disease. Although single frequency wrist- ankle BIA may be useful in population studies as a noninvasive predictor of body cell mass. FFM, or total body water, it appears to be an unrepresentative measure of these compartments of individual subjects.},

abstract = {Background: Nutritional status is an important prognostic factor in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) prior to lung transplantation. Objective: To investigate the impact of nutritional status on pulmonary function in CF transplant recipients. Methods: Adult double lung transplanted CF patients were consecutively included. The predictive value of nutritional status on lung function – measured by spirometry – was longitudinally assessed by body composition serially evaluated by a three-compartment model bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in comparison to body mass index (BMI). Results: Overall, 147 spirometries and 147 BIAs were performed in 58 patients (59% female, median age: 30.1 years, median BMI: 19.6 kg/m2). Malnourished patients (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2; 27.6%) had a significantly reduced lung function compared to normal/overweight patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 second in percent (FEV1%pred), 57% vs 77%; p = 0.024). BMI, as well as the BIA parameters phase angle, total body water, fat free mass, body cell mass (BCM) and extracellular mass (ECM)/BCM ratio, were univariate predictors of FEV1%pred. When included in a linear mixed model, ECM/BCM ratio remained the only significant predictor of lung function (p = 0.012). Conclusion: Nutritional status assessed by BIA predicted lung function in CF transplant recipients. Serial BIA measurements to monitor patients' nutritional status might help to improve or maintain lung function.},

abstract = {Introduction: Nutritional status, assessed by body mass index (BMI), is associated with pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. BMI may be too crude as it does not distinguish patients with differences in body composition. Therefore, we investigated whether the fat free mass index (FFMI), fat mass index (FMI), or phase angle have stronger associations with pulmonary function and better detect the risk for malnutrition than BMI. Methods: Body composition was measured in 140 adult CF patients using whole-body single frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA, Body stat 500). Pulmonary function, assessed by spirometry, was expressed as Forced Expiratory Volume at 1 second percent predicted (FEV1%pred). Associations of body composition measures with pulmonary function, adjusted for age, gender and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection were investigated with Pearson's r and multiple linear regression. Results: Weak positive significant associations with FEV1%pred were observed for BMI (r= 0.2, p=0.018), FFMI (r= 0.2, p=0.023) and phase angle (r= 0.3, p= 0.002). The association with FMI was not significant (r= 0.1, p=0.274). After adjusting for covariates, BMI, FFMI, FMI and phase angle were all similarly significant associated with FEV1%pred (p= <0.001). BMI showed the strongest association with FMI (r= 0.8, p=0.000). BMI detected 13 out of 140 patients at risk of malnutrition, whereas FFMI detected 25 patients. Conclusion: Body composition measures are similarly associated with pulmonary function. BMI does not adequately detect patients at risk of malnutrition. Therefore, FFMI combined with BMI should assess nutritional status in adult CF patients with low and normal BMI.},

This study investigated the impact of nutritional status on LF in adult CF patients after LT. Methods: Consecutive adult double-lung transplanted CF patients attending our CF outpatient service between Jan 2012 and Jul 2015 were included. The impact of body composition (BC) as assessed by 3 compartment model bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), BMI, as well as 25-hydroxy (OH)-vitamin D-levels on LF was investigated at initial and follow-up visits. Results: In total 147 LF tests and BIAs were performed in 58 patients (59% female; median age: 30.1 y; median BMI: 19.6 kg/m2; 77.6% diabetes, 96.6% pancreatic insufficiency, 81% F508del carrier) at up to 5 time points per patient. Malnourished patients (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2; 28%) had a significantly reduced LF compared to normal/overweight patients (median FEV1%pred 57% vs. 77%, p = 0.024). During median follow up of 0.6 years (range: 0.3-2.4 y), FEV1%pred loss in malnourished patients was substantially higher than in normal/overweight patients. BMI, as well as the single BIA parameters phase angle, total body water, fat free mass, body cell mass (BCM), and extracellular mass (ECM)/BCM ratio were univariate predictors of LF as assessed by FEV1%pred. When included in a stepwise logistic regression model ECM/BCM ratio (OR =-15.427, 95%CI:-27.273;-3.581, p = 0.012) remained the only significant predictor of LF. Vitamin D-deficiency (median vitamin D-level: 37.2 nmol/L; range: 10.0-91.1) was present in 93.1% of patients and significantly correlated with VCmax and FEV1. Conclusion: Malnutrition and vitamin D-deficiency are highly prevalent in CF patients after LT. BC as assessed by BIA was superior to BMI in prediction of LF. Continuous care by dietitians and gastroenterologists trained in CF care might improve nutritional status and LF in CF patients after LT.},

abstract = {Background: Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a devastating human autosomal recessive disorder that causes progressive cerebellar ataxia, immunodeficiency, premature aging, chromosomal instability and increased cancer risk. Affected patients show growth failure, poor weight gain, low body mass index (BMI), myopenia and increased fatigue during adolescence. The prevalence of alterations in body composition, muscle strength and hormonal status has not been well described in classical A-T patients. Additionally, no current guidelines are available for the assessment and management of these changes. Methods: We analyzed body composition, manual muscle strength and hormonal status in 25 A-T patients and 26 age-matched, healthy controls. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was performed to evaluate the body composition, fat-free mass (FFM), body cell mass (BCM), extracellular matrix (ECM), phase angle (PhA), fat mass (FM) and ECM to BCM ratio. Manual muscle strength was measured using a hydraulic hand dynamometer. Results: The BMI, FFM and PhA were significantly lower in A-T patients than in controls (BMI 16.56 ± 3.52 kg/m2 vs. 19.86 ± 3.54 kg/m2; Z-Score: -1.24 ± 1.29 vs. 0.05 ± 0.92, p <0.001; FFM 25.4 ± 10.03 kg vs. 41.77 ± 18.25 kg, p < 0.001; PhA: 4.6 ± 0.58° vs. 6.15 ± 0.88°, p < 0.001). Manual muscle strength was significantly impaired in A-T patients compared with controls (10.65 ± 10.97 kg vs. 26.8 ± 30.39 kg, p < 0.0001). In addition, cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels were significantly lower in A-T patients than in controls. Conclusion: Altered body composition, characterized by depleted BMI, PhA and BCM; by the need to sit in a wheelchair; by altered hormone levels; and by poor muscle strength, is a major factor underlying disease progression and increased fatigue in A-T patients.},

We hypothesized that pulmonary rehabilitation subsequently following lung transplantation (LTx) improves BC and exercise performance. Methods: between February 2008 and February 2009 patients after LTx underwent 3-week in-patient rehabilitation. Bio impedance analysis (BIA: lean body mass (LBM), body cell mass (BCM), BCM/LBM ratio, phase angle (PA), body weight, lung function testing (VC, FEV1, 6-min.-walk (6-MW), ergospirometry (max. workload (maxWL)), anaerobic threshold (AT) and activities of daily living (ADL) were recorded at baseline and at the end. Results: 73 patients (median age (IQR): 47 (35-59) years, m:f 41:32) after LTx (single 9, bilateral 58, heart-lung 6) were included. 24 suffered emphysema (COPD), 13 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (iPF), 17 cystic fibrosis (CF), 7 pulmonary hypertension (PH), 7 Re-do-LTx for BOS and 5 other diseases. Overall improvement (baseline vs. end) revealed: VC (median 58 (IQR 46 - 67) vs. 66 (54-78) %, p < 0.001), FEV1 (56 (45-69) vs. 67 (54 - 78)%, p < 0.001), 6-MW (321 (200-417) vs. 425 (332-515) m, p < 0.001), maxWL (33 (27-42) vs. 41 (34-50)%, p < 0.001), ADL (mean 95 (± 8) vs. 99 (±2 ), p < 0.001). AT did not enhance. Overall body weight (61.5 (50.9 - 72.2) vs. 61.7 (51.0 -71.8), p = 0.16) and LBM did not change. BCM (17.2 (14.2-21.3) vs. 17.4 (15.0-22.1), p < 0.01), BCM/LBM ratio (37.0 (33.6-40.5) vs. 38.8 (35.4-42.3), p < 0.001), PA (3.6 (3.2-4.1) vs. 3.8 (3.4-4.3), p < 0.001) improved significantly. In BIA subgroup analysis CF (BCM 16 (12-21) vs. 17 (13-23), p = 0.002, BCM/LBM (38 (36-42) vs. 41 (37-44), p = 0.001), PA (3.7 (3.4-4.2) vs. 4.1 (3.6-4.6), p = 0.001), PH (BCM/LBM (37 (34-40) vs. 41 (35-44), p = 0.018, PA 3.6 (3.2-3.9) vs. 4.1 (3.4-4.6), p = 0.017) and BOS (BCM 17 (13-17) vs. 18 (12-22), p = 0.04, BCM/LBM 33 (30-39) vs. 37 (33-40), p = 0.05, PA 3.1 (2.8- 3.8) vs. 3.5 (3.1-4.0), p = 0.05) demonstrated pronounced effects in BIA, while COPD and iPF did not. Conclusion: a pulmonary 3-week in-patient rehabilitation following lung-transplantation improves exercise performance overall. Significant improvement in body composition was observed in CF, PH and BOS patients only. COPD and iPF patients showed insignificant changes. Longer duration of pre-transplant disease, co-morbidity and advanced age may account for these results.},

Routinely BMI is used as a marker of malnutrition but Bio-electrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is now widely used method in body composition assessment. Our aim was to evaluate relationship between BMI, pulmonary function tests and BIA variables - fat free mass (FFM), sarcopenic index (SI), phase angle (PA) and fat free mass index (FFMI). Methods: 30 adult CF patients treated in adult CF centre in Croatia were included. After obtaining basic demographic, anthropometric and clinical data, each patient had pulmonary function tests and BIA performed. Results: 30 CF patients (17F, 13M) entered the study. Mean age, FEV1, BMI and FFMI were 24.7 years (range 17–34), 2.03 L (range 0.53–4.38), 13.1 kg/m2 (range 13.1–28.7) and 16.9 kg/m2 (range 12.9–21.5), respectively. We found positive correlations between FEV1 and BMI, FFMI, PA and SI (r = 0.31, p = 0.09; r = 0.52, p = 0.0002; r = 0.45, p = 0.01; r = 0.65, p = 0.0001, respectively). Multiple linear regression showed statistically significant influence of sarcopenia on pulmonary function (p = 0.04). There was a 0.4 increase in SI for each extra litre in FEV1. Conclusion: We have presented the first evaluation of nutritional status on national level regarding adult CF population in Croatia. Sarcopenic index may be a better prognostic indicator of severe pulmonary dysfunction in adult CF patients than BMI, and the early recognition of malnutrition by BIA may improve clinical outcomes. These preliminary results point towards the importance of an interdisciplinary approach and obligatory body composition studies while assessing CF patients.},

Recent methods for the determination of FFM are dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The purpose of this study was to determine if the BIA-determined FFM as estimated by the formula by Kotler et al.1 and the Geneva formula2 could be validated when compared to DXA-determined FFM in subjects with various diagnoses. Body composition was measured by BIA and DXA in 480 subjects including healthy young men and women, elite female runners, and patients with various pathologies (including chronic obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disease patients; cystic fibrosis patients; lung, heart, and liver transplantation patients [both pre- and post-], and hemiplegic and AIDS patients). The present results suggest that BIA is relevant in the clinical assessment of body composition, but BIA formulas appropriate to the subject pool must be used for evaluation of FFM and fat mass. The BIA formula by Kotler et al.1 is appropriate for healthy subjects and patients with AIDS, cystic fibrosis, and pre- or postliver transplantation. The Geneva formula2 is more appropriate in pulmonary diseases and hemiplegic subjects with normal weight. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {Objectives: In healthy adults, protein intake is positively associated with fat-free mass (FFM). We investigated the association between protein intake and FFM or its height-corrected index (FFMI) in adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Additionally, the association between muscle strength and FFM(I) was investigated. Methods: FFM(I) (kg, kg/m2) was determined by whole body single frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (Bodystat 500) in 105 adult CF patients. Protein intake was estimated from a dietary history and expressed as % of energy intake (EN%). Muscle strength expressed as isometric knee extension strength (%pred) (n = 71) was determined by a Cybex or MicroFET II dynamometer. Associations were tested by multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Protein intake ranged from 10.9 to 31.0 EN%. Mean FFM across tertiles of protein intake (EN%) was 50.7 kg, 48.4 kg and 52.9 kg (P = 0.401) whereas mean FFMI was 16.5 kg/m2, 16.1 kg/m2 and 17.2 kg/m2, respectively (P = 0.132). A low FFM and FFMI was observed in 7 and 21 patients, respectively. Adjusted for age and gender, protein intake was significantly associated with FFM (B = 0.507 kg per 2EN%, P = 0.047) and with FFMI (B = 0.165 kg/m2 per 2EN%, P = 0.012). Muscle strength was significantly associated with FFM (B = 0.893 kg per 5%, P = 0.000) and FFMI (B = 0.167 kg/m2 per 5%, P = 0.000). Conclusion: A higher protein intake and higher muscle strength were significantly associated with a higher FFM(I). Further research should focus on protein intake and muscle strength improvement in CF patients with low FFM(I).},

The effect of Ivacaftor on body weight seems to occur within weeks of commencing therapy. Long term effects on weight are emerging, however, body composition changes are undocumented. Objectives: To evaluate 5 and 24 month treatment effects of Ivacaftor on weight, BMI and body composition in CF adults with the G551D-CFTR mutation. Methods:We undertook a prospective study of Ivacaftor in 20 adults with CF.1 Data were available at 24 months of treatment for 11 of these adults (mean ± SD age 33.5 ± 13.1 years, BMI 23.4 ± 3.4 kg/m2, FEV1 61.8 ± 22.9%; 7 male). Using Multifrequency Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (SECA, Germany), we measured weight, fat mass (FM) and fat free mass (FFM) at baseline, five and 24 months. Change data were determined and repeated measures ANOVA undertaken. Results: Mean weight, BMI and FM significantly increased following five months of Ivacaftor treatment ($\Delta$Weight 3.2 ± 2.2 kg, p = 0.002; $\Delta$BMI 1.22 ± 0.8 kg/m2, p = 0.002; $\Delta$FM 2.37 ± 1.1 kg, p = 0.0005). No significant changes were observed for FFM ($\Delta$FFM 0.8 ± 1.3 kg, p = 0.21). No further increases were observed forweight, BMI and FM between 5 and 24 months of treatment exposure ($\Delta$Weight 0.04 ± 3.5 kg, p = 1.0; $\Delta$BMI -0.06 ± 1.2 kg/m2, p = 1.0; $\Delta$FM -0.15 ± 2.35 kg, p = 1.0). Whilst most patients (45.5%) were within normal BMI range at baseline, 36.4% were overweight. This increased to 54.4% at 24 months with two patients moving from the normal to the overweight category. In this cohort $\Delta$FEV1%was not associated with a $\Delta$weight, $\Delta$FM or $\Delta$FFM at 5 or 24 months. Conclusion: Weight, BMI and FM gains are observed within the first 5 months of Ivacaftor treatment, followed by a plateauing thereafter by 2 years. The metabolic and clinical consequences of weight and fat mass gains from normal to overweight BMI categories are yet to be determined.},

abstract = {Introduction: Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor was approved for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients ≥12 years old in October 2019. Clinical studies have shown impressive weight gain in patients on this triple combination therapy (TCT). There are no body composition goals set for CF patients as these standards have not yet been validated in the CF population and there are no data showing the effects of TCT on body composition. There are limitations of BMI, such as the lack of knowledge of the patient's body fat percentage (BF%) and skeletal muscle mass (SMM). We aim to improve our knowledge of TCT effects on CF patient's body composition over time so we may provide more effective nutritional and physical activity recommendations with a goal towards health weight gain. Method: The clinic offers InBody Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis scans. The care team then evaluates the patient, reviews results and offers dietary and exercise recommendations. Our patients were instructed to continue their previous nutritional recommendations, exercise regimens, and daily activities after starting TCT. Eligible patients received a pre- and post-InBody assessment using the following criteria: they must have had InBody test prior to starting TCT and be in the clinic for post-testing within 3 months of starting TCT. We measured weight, BMI, skeletal muscle mass, and body fat percentage (BF%) before starting TCT and at post-testing. Results: The adult center has 143 patients. Of these, 38 completed baseline InBody testing, exercise and nutrition assessment prior to starting TCT. Eighteen out of the 38 patients (47%) completed the study with a post-TCT assessment. Study patients showed significant weight gain with mean weight increasing from 144 to 151 pounds. Mean BMI increased from 23 to 24. There was an improvement in SMM (60.23 to 61.7 lb), with minimal change in BF% (24.6% to 24.8%). After starting TCT, 11/18 (61%) reported increased appetite, prolonged stamina during exercise, and increased appetite after exercise. Conclusion: In this study there was a notable increase in SMM with minimal change in BF%. SMM increases are more desirable due to skeletal tissue's roles in the body as it contributes to mobility, stability, posture, circulation, and digestion. TCT promoted weight gain and improvements in SMM with minimal change in BF%. Given this preliminary data it is unknown if these changes in body composition are directly related to TCT or an effect of the improved energy levels and exercise tolerance, that were seen in the majority of our patients. Larger studies are needed to further evaluate these results. As CF patients live longer it is imperative that healthcare providers prepare them for healthy aging. Part of this is encouraging proper exercise and the intake of a healthy diet. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted our study by decreasing our sample size dramatically, hence it is not statistically significant. Post-assessments were halted due to cancellations of in-clinic visits. Our clinic will continue to measure baseline- and post-assessments, focusing on sustainable clinic flow operations, increasing education, and increasing sample size through collaboration with the pediatric CF center.},

Methods - Fourteen cystic fibrosis patients aged 6 to 20 years were studied and compared to 14 healthy controls matched for gender, age, and nutritional status. Bone mineral content was determined by dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Results - Nutritional inquiry showed higher ingestion of macronutrients and micronutrients by cystic fibrosis patients than by controls. Mean whole skeleton bone mineral content was 1.184 (SD 0.536) kg in cystic fibrosis patients and 1.229 (0.576) kg in controls (p = 0.84). Mean lumbar spine bone mineral content was 0.031 (0.013) kg and 0.031 (0.016) kg, respectively (p = 0.99). Anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and DEXA showed that fat-free mass was similar in the two groups. Bone mineral content was strongly correlated to fat-free mass. A lean blood calcium, phosphorus, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and osteocalcin were similar in both groups. Conclusions - Bone mineral content and body composition are normal in a well nourished young cystic fibrosis population. Osteopenia previously reported in cystic fibrosis patients probably has nutritional origins and is therefore not related to a primary defect in bone mineral metabolism.},

We aim to appraise the type and frequency of application of body composition (BC) methods in child and adult patients with CF. Methods: We used 4 databases (Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) to perform the literature search. The search was conducted from January 2017 to February 2017. Two independent reviewers selected articles based on titles and abstracts to check eligibility for inclusion. All study designs or types of articles (abstract, full text) were considered. Results: Eighty-four full-text articles and 40 studies presented only as abstracts were selected. Sixty-four studies included children and adolescents (age range of 0.1–18 years), and 41 studies recruited adults (range of 18–57 years); 13 studies included both age groups. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used in 56 studies (33.9%), and bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) was used in 12 studies (9.7%), whereas 38 studies (30.6%) combined different methods (up to 5 different methods) to assess BC. Conclusions: The results show a large variability in the application of BC methods in patients with CF that makes the comparison between studies difficult.

abstract = {Objectives: Bio-electrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is a widely used method to assess body composition. The present study aimed at testing whether measurements in the non-fasting state deviated from those in the fasting state in Dutch adult CF patients and evaluate the relationship between pulmonary function and Fat Free Mass (FFM) compared to Body Mass Index (BMI). Methods: Data from 47 CF patientswere collected from September 2017 to January 2018. Body composition was measured by Body stat{\textregistered} 500 and pulmonary function by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) percentage predicted. Differences between the fasting and non-fasting state were analysed with paired sample t-tests. Correlations were tested with Pearson's r for parametric data. Results: 33 adult CF patients (16 men) had both fasting and non-fasting BIA data. Fasting mean FFM was 51.72 kg, which was only 0.1 kg (0.2%) lower than the non-fasting mean FFM of 51.82 kg (p = 0.508). Fasting mean Fat Mass (FM)was 16.58 kg, whichwas 0.1 kg (0.5%) more than the non-fasting mean FM of 16.47 kg (p = 0.483). Data of 47 non-fasting CF patients (21 men, mean BMI 22.3 kg/m2, IQR [20.3-23.6], mean FFM 50.0 ± 10.27, mean FEV1% 64.61 ± 22.83) showed that both FFM and BMI were positively and significantly correlated with pulmonary function (r = 0.444, p = 0.002, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.65 and r = 0.359, p = 0.017, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.59, respectively). Conclusions: These results suggest that the differences in FFM and FM between the fasting and non-fasting state are not clinically relevant. In addition, FFM is positively associated with pulmonary function with little difference from BMI possibly due to the adequate nutritional status of the study population.

abstract = {Background: The accuracy of body composition estimates based on skinfold thickness measurements and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is not yet adequately explored in cystic fibrosis (CF). Using DXA as reference method we verified the accuracy of these techniques and identified predictors of body composition specific for CF. Methods: One hundred forty-two CF patients (age range: 8-31. years) underwent a DXA scan. Body fat percentage (BF%) was estimated from skinfolds, while fat free mass (FFM) from single-frequency 50. kHz BIA. Results: Bland-Altman analysis showed poor intra-individual agreement between body composition data provided by DXA and BF% estimated from skinfolds or FFM estimated from BIA. The skinfolds of the upper arm were better predictors of BF% than BMI, while compared to other BIA measurements the best predictor of FFM was the R-index (Height2/Resistance). Conclusions: Due to poor accuracy at individual level, the estimates of body composition obtained from these techniques cannot be part of the standard nutritional assessment of CF patients until reliable CF-specific equations will become available. BMI has limited value in predicting body fatness in CF patients and should be used in combination with other predictors. Skinfolds of the upper arm and R-index are strongly related to BF% and FFM and should be tested in a large CF population to develop specific predictive equations.},

abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to assess the ability of commercially available single frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to predict total body water and hence body composition in a cohort of children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods: In 56 (31 girls, 25 boys) children aged 4 to 18 years, total body water was predicted using BIA and measured using a deuterium oxide dilution technique. Each child provided a urine sample before consuming 0.5 g/kg body weight 10% deuterium oxide. A further urine sample was collected between 4 and 6 h later. Results: There was a mean bias between predicted and measured total body water of 1.1 L. The bias was consistent across the range of total body water measured in this study. The relationship between height2/impedance and measured total body water was TBW=0.35+0.74*height2/impedance. This equation is similar to other equations found in healthy children. Conclusion: We have shown that a commercially available bioelectrical device underestimates measured total body water. We have generated a prediction equation for the population studied, which we believe might enhance the accuracy of the method in children with cystic fibrosis. {\textcopyright} 2004 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.

abstract = {Nutritional status must be closely monitored in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. This study compared three methods of measuring body composition in CF patients and then examined the relationships between two simple anthropometric markers of nutritional status - tricipital skinfold thickness (TSK) and arm muscular circumference (AMC) - and the results given by each method. Fifty-five patients with CF, 27 females and 28 males, participated in this study. The mean age at the time of the study was 14 ± 5 years, ranging from 4 to 29 years. The four skinfolds (SK) and arm circumference were measured in all patients and fat mass (FM) and AMC were calculated. Fifty patients underwent dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and 38 underwent bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The values for FM as calculated by the three methods were highly correlated, as were the values for lean body mass (LM) (p< 0.001). The LM assessed by anthropometry was overestimated by 8 ± 4% compared with DEXA and by 6 ± 7% compared with BIA. BIA overestimated LM by 4 ± 6% compared with DEXA (p< 0.001). The LM values measured by SK, DEXA, and BIA were highly correlated with AMC (p< 0.001) and FM calculated using these three techniques were highly correlated with TSK (p< 0.001). The measurement of TSK and AMC are simple and rapid ways to evaluate body composition. The excellent correlation between the three methods used to measure body composition suggests that they are valid for use in patients with CF, but the results were not identical. The measurement from each technique must be interpreted according to its own norms and comparisons can only be made if the same technique is used in the same patient. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Chronic pulmonary infection and intestinal malabsorption often lead to malnutrition in children and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). Appetite stimulants, along with provision of adequate calories, may aid in overcoming nutritional deficits, allowing a better prognosis. We undertook a trial of cyproheptadine hydrochloride (CH) to determine its effectiveness as an appetite stimulant in 18 adults and children with CF. This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of CH vs. placebo. Eighteen subjects with documented CF (sweat or genetics positive), minimum age of 5 years, and ideal body weight for height <100% were entered, and 16 completed the study. Subjects were seen at baseline and every 4 weeks. Measures included baseline demographics, Shwachman score, anthropometrics (weight, height, body mass index, skin folds, and body composition by bioelectric impedance analysis), spirometry, caloric intake, days of oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) antibiotics, and a symptom and satisfaction survey. Subjects in the CH group showed significant increases in weight (mean 3.45 kg vs. 1.1 kg in the placebo group), height, BMI percentiles, ideal body weight/height, weight for age z-scores, and fat and fat-free mass. There were no changes or differences in PO or IV antibiotic use or spirometric changes. No significant side effects except transient mild sedation occurred in the CH group. Patient acceptance was good. In conclusion, CH appears to be an effective appetite stimulant with minimal side effects in children and adults with CF. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Nutritional status (NS) is associated with respiratory outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Currently, NS in adults with CF is commonly assessed using body mass index (BMI) which can underestimate the prevalence of malnutrition. Muscle mass (MM) is positively associated with clinical outcomes and measures of body composition improve the nutritional assessment of patients with CF. Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between body composition and the key respiratory outcomes of FEV1 and IV antibiotic requirement. To examine the presence of normal weight obesity (NWO). This was defined as a high body fat percentage (>23% for females &?>30% for males) with a normal BMI (<25 kg/m2). Methods: 18 subjects with CF underwent bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), a form of body composition analysis. Lung function was determined as the percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%), as part of routine care. The number of days treatment with IV antibiotics was determined retrospectively for the previous (2019) calendar year. Data was analysed using a correlation coefficient (r). Results: MM% was negatively associated with the number of days treatment with IV antibiotics (r = 0.50, p = 0.04), but there was no significant association between MM% and FEV1% (r = 0.16, p = 0.06). Demographics: [Table Presented] Conclusion: The association of higher MM% with lower IV antibiotic requirement supports the importance of nutritional assessment in this patient group. The lack of significant association between MM% and FEV1% may be due to the limited sample size. The prevalence of NWO was high in these subjects. Identification of NWO can allow targeted intervention to increase MM and this may improve key respiratory outcomes in CF. This supports the use of body composition measures to assess nutritional status rather than BMI alone. Data collection will continue that may strengthen the current results.},

Linear regression analysis showed that TBK was highly correlated (r > 0.93) with height2/impedance, weight, height, and fat-free mass (FFM) estimated from skin-fold measurements. Changes in TBK were also correlated, but less well, with changes in height2/impedance, weight, height, and FFM (r = 0.69, 0.59, 0.44, and 0.40, respectively). The children were divided into two groups: those who had normal accretion of TBK (>5%/y) and those who had suboptimal accretion of TBK (<5%/y). Analysis of variance showed that the significant difference in the change in TBK between the groups was detectable by concomitant changes in impedance and weight but not by changes in height, FFM, or weight and height Z scores. The results of this study suggest that serial BIA measures may he useful as a predictor of progressive undernutrition and poor growth in children with cystic fibrosis.},

abstract = {Objectives: Current clinical practice relies heavily on BMI and weight, but these alone will fail to identify adults with CF (AWCF) with excess or depleted fat mass (FM) or fat free mass (FFM). This service evaluation aims to describe the body composition of AWCF at a UK CF centre using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), to examine the prevalence of previously undetectable anthropometric states including ‘hidden obesity' (called normal weight obesity - NWO), and to examine the relationship with clinical parameters. Methods: BIA data collected as part of dietetic clinic assessment from 2017 to 2019 using TANITA 780 model. BIA measurements included FFM, body fat (BF)%, BF kg, phase angle (PA). Clinical data was also collected. NWO has been defined as BMI < 25 kg/m2 and body fat >30% women, >23% men. Results: Data for 174 AWCF (53% male) aged 17–72 years were analysed. Based on BMI alone, 26/174 were classified as overweight (BMI>25 kg/m2) and 5/174 were classified as obese (BMI>30 kg/m2). 25/174(14%) had NWO. Statistical analysis was performed to compare those with NWO and AWCF who had normal weight and normal FFM; mean BMI 20.3 v 22.75 (p = 0.7). FEV1% 74 v 63% ± 0.24 v 0.24 (p = 0.04); Phase angle (PA) 6.25 v 5.82 ± 0.91 v 0.67 (p = 0.03). Conclusion: This data suggests that current standard anthropometric measures are missing a substantial number of AWCF who are obese, and that this is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Results show NWO is associated with both lower lung function and phase angle (a measure of overall body health). Currently a third of our CF population have excess body fat (combination of overweight, obese and NWO). With the advent of CFTR modulator therapies, nutrition in PWCF will improve and obesity and its complications are likely to increase in prevalence. Dietetic practice needs to adapt to the evolving CF population, however reversing long-term dietary habits may prove challenging.},

abstract = {Body composition analysis is an important component of nutritional assessment in cystic fibrosis (CF). No gold standard of measurement exists, and techniques applicable to healthy populations may be unsuitable for CF patients. We assessed lean body mass (LBM) in 12 children with CF by skinfold (SK) measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and dual-photon absorptiometry (DPA) and repeated these measures in 10 subjects 6 mo later. SK and DPA measures in eight older CF patients and eight healthy controls were compared to evaluate any effect of disease on estimates of LBM by use of DPA. Good agreement between the measures was seen at baseline and 6 mo by use of concordance plots. However, the limits of agreement between measures ranged up to 19% of SK-derived LBM measures (baseline: SK and DPA, 2.63 to - 3.93 kg; SK and BIA, 2.36 to -1.24 kg; BIA and DPA, 1.88 to -4.28 kg; 6 mo: SK and DPA, 2.10 to -3.58 kg; SK and BIA, 6.28 to -5.49 kg; BIA and DPA, 5.53 to -7.79 kg). The change in LBM over 6 mo did not correlate among the three measures. Only BIA change in LBM correlated with weight change (r = 0.716, P < 0.02), probably due to the inclusion of weight in the regression equations for determining LBM from impedance. The relationship between SK and DPA measures did not differ between the CF and control groups, suggesting that there was no effect of disease on the DPA measure. The results suggest that none of these methods is precise enough to follow short-term changes in the nutritional status of CF patients longitudinally.},

abstract = {Rationale: Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) from thoracic computed tomography (CT) has been utilized as a marker of low muscle mass, however its relationship to overall fat free mass has not been established. Furthermore, the measurement of body fat from thoracic CT has not been explored. The study objectives were: 1) to determine the reliability of measuring body fat compartments from thoracic CT and 2) to evaluate the criterion validity of muscle and fat CSA obtained from thoracic CT as measures of body composition compared to a reference standard, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Methods: Thoracic CT scans were obtained from medical records of people listed for lung transplantation. BIA was done at least 4 weeks after transplant listing. Total thoracic muscle CSA, pectoral muscle CSA (-29 to 150 HU), subcutaneous fat anterior to the pectoral muscles (-190 to -30 HU), and intrathoracic fat in the mediastinal region (-150 to -50 HU) were manually segmented at the level of the carina using Slice-O-Matic. Reliability testing was done by two independent raters and analysed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Muscle CSAs were correlated to fat free mass index (FFMI) and fat CSAs to body fat mass index (BFMI) and percent body fat (%BF) obtained from BIA. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between body composition and fat CSA, accounting for age and sex. Results: Fifty subjects were included (29 males, age=59±9 yrs), with diagnoses of interstitial lung disease (n=32), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=12), pulmonary hypertension (n=4) and cystic fibrosis (n=2). Reliability analysis showed excellent intra-rater (ICC=0.99) and inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.99) for both subcutaneous and intrathoracic fat. Body composition is shown in the Table. Total thoracic muscle CSA had a stronger correlation to FFMI (r =0.46, p< 0.001) than pectoral muscle CSA (r=0.28, p=0.05). Muscle CSAs did not correlate to BMI (r= -0.1-0.01, p>0.50). Subcutaneous fat CSA showed moderate correlations with BFMI (r=0.80, p<0.001), %BF (r=0.66, p<0.001) and BMI (r=0.76, p <0.001). Intrathoracic fat only correlated with BMI (r = 0.58, p <0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that for every 1 kg/m2 increase in BFMI, there was a 6.2cm2 increase in subcutaneous fat (adjusted for age and sex). Conclusions: This study supports the reliability and validity of using thoracic CT to measure muscle and fat. Future studies are needed to investigate the relationship between body composition using this method and clinical outcomes in individuals with advanced lung disease. (Table Presnted).},

abstract = {This paper considers the argument for obesity as a chronic relapsing disease process. Obesity is viewed from an epidemiological model, with an agent affecting the host and producing disease. Food is the primary agent, particularly foods that are high in energy density such as fat, or in sugar-sweetened beverages. An abundance of food, low physical activity and several other environmental factors interact with the genetic susceptibility of the host to produce positive energy balance. The majority of this excess energy is stored as fat in enlarged, and often more numerous fat cells, but some lipid may infiltrate other organs such as the liver (ectopic fat). The enlarged fat cells and ectopic fat produce and secrete a variety of metabolic, hormonal and inflammatory products that produce damage in organs such as the arteries, heart, liver, muscle and pancreas. The magnitude of the obesity and its adverse effects in individuals may relate to the virulence or toxicity of the environment and its interaction with the host. Thus, obesity fits the epidemiological model of a disease process except that the toxic or pathological agent is food rather than a microbe. Reversing obesity will prevent most of its detrimental effects.},

abstract = {Background & aims: There is an increase in the number of patients worldwide with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Current medical practice guidelines warn against performing bioimpedance analysis (BIA) in this group of patients in order to avoid any electromagnetic interference. These recommendations restrict using the BIA in patients undergoing heart failure or with nutrition disorders in whom BIA could be of major interest in detecting peripheral congestion and to help guide treatment. The present study was conducted to evaluate whether BIA caused electromagnetic interference in patients having CIEDs. Methods: Patient enrollment was conducted during routine face-to-face consultations for scheduled CIEDs interrogations. Device battery voltage, lead impedance, pacing thresholds and device electrograms were recorded before and after each BIA measurement to detect any electromagnetic interference or oversensing. Results: A total of 200 patients were enrolled. During BIA, no significant changes in battery voltage, lead impedance or pacing thresholds were detected, nor were there any inappropriate over- or undersensing observed in intracardiac electrograms. Furthermore, 6- and 12-month follow-up did not reveal any changes in CIEDs. Conclusions: This study shows no interference in patients equipped with CIEDs and suggests that BIA can be securely performed in these patients. Trial registered under the identifier NCT03045822.},

abstract = {Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a method extensively used in studies assessing body composition, especially in view of the high speed of information processing, as a noninvasive method for generating information through portable, easy to use and relatively inexpensive equipment that estimates the distribution of body fluids in the intra- and intercellular spaces in addition to the body components. This technique consists of the passage of a painless low amplitude electrical current applied through cables connected to electrodes or to conducting surfaces placed in contact with the skin, permitting the measurement of resistance (R) and reactance (Xc). These R and Xc values applied to mathematical equations permit the estimate of the following body compartments: fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and total body water (TBW). In this respect, the objective of the present report is to review the main concepts involved in the BIA technique, to describe the types of BIA available, their limitations and applications to clinical practice, especially the monitoring of chronic diseases. After this review, we conclude that BIA is an important instrument for health professionals and that its use can provide safe data about body composition, in addition to complementary data about the clinical course of patients followed up on a medium- and long-term basis.},

abstract = {Background: Oral contraceptive (OC) use seems to have little effect on weight change in normal weight women. Most previous studies have excluded obese women, so the effect of OC use on weight change in obese women is unknown. Methods: This analysis evaluates weight and body composition change with OC use among obese (body mass index [BMI] 30.0-39.9) and normal weight (BMI 19.0-24.9) women who were randomly assigned to two OC doses: 20 $\mu$g ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 100 $\mu$g levonorgestrel (LNG) OCs or 30 $\mu$g EE and 150 $\mu$g LNG OCs. Follow-up occurred after three to four OC cycles. Weight and body composition were measured at baseline and at follow-up using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer. Results: Among 150 women (54 obese and 96 normal weight) who used OCs for 3 to 4 months, there were no clinically or statistically significant weight or body composition changes in the overall group or by BMI or OC formulation group. Conclusions: These findings add to evidence that EE/LNG OCs are not associated with short term weight or body composition change for normal weight women and suggest that OCs are also are not associated with short term weight or body composition change in obese women. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.},

abstract = {Purpose: To examine whether menstrual cycle affects body composition and bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA) patterns, jumping and sprinting ability, and flexibility in elite soccer players. Methods: A total of 20 elite female soccer players (age: 23.8 [3.4] y, height: 1.63 [0.04] m, body mass: 61.4 [5.9] kg, and body mass index: 22.5 [2.4] kg/m2) were monitored during the early follicular and ovulatory phase across 2 consecutive menstrual cycles. Bioimpedance analysis was performed using foot-to-hand technology, and total body water and fat mass were determined by specific equations developed for athletes. Bioelectrical resistance and reactance were adjusted according to the BIVA procedures and plotted as a vector within the resistance-reactance graph. In addition, countermovement jump, 20-m sprint, and sit and reach were assessed. Results: A time effect (P < .05) was found for body mass, total body water, bioelectrical resistance and reactance, and flexibility. Specifically, body mass increased (P = .021) along with a gain in total body water (P = .001) from the ovulatory to the early follicular phase, while it decreased from the early follicular to the ovulatory phase during the second menstrual cycle. The BIVA vector shortened during the early follicular phases (P < .001). No change in jumping and sprinting capacity was observed (P > .05). Flexibility was impaired during the early follicular phases (P < .05). Conclusions: Specific bioelectrical impedance analysis and BIVA procedures are able to detect menstrual cycle-induced changes in body composition in elite soccer players. The early follicular phase resulted in fluid accumulations and BIVA vector shortening. In addition, while menstrual cycle did not affect performance, a fluctuation in flexibility was observed.},

The measurement values by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were used as a reference of the body composition. In terms of the results, regardless of the menopausal status, BIA slightly but significantly overestimated the percentage of body fat (standard error of estimate: 5.3%-6.7%) and the leg lean soft tissue mass (LSTM; 5.1%-6.1%), and underestimated the LSTM in the whole body (6.2%-7.6%) and arm (2.8%-3.7%). The absolute values of the predictive error for leg LSTM were significantly higher in postmenopausal groups than in the premenopausal ones. The corresponding values for the whole body and arm LSTM, and the percentage of body fat were higher in premenopausal groups than in postmenopausal ones. In conclusion, the predictive accuracy of BIA for postmenopausal women is not inferior to that for premenopausal ones, unless we target the leg LSTM.},

Method: Eighty women (mean age, 24.6 years) were randomized into three groups and given one of the following contraceptive methods: ethinylestradiol 15 $\mu$g/gestodene 60 $\mu$g (EE/GST, n=25), ethinylestradiol 30 $\mu$g/drospirenone 3 mg (EE/DRS, n=29) or male condom (control group, n=26). Bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) was carried out on the first, 10th and 21st days during the use of oral contraceptives or in the menstrual cycle (control group), and total body water (TBW), fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) were measured. Results: No significant variations in TBW, FM or FFM were observed in the three groups during the cycle. Intergroup analysis showed no differences in TBW or FM; however, users of EE/GST showed a statistically significant increase in FFM compared to the control group. Conclusion: The different doses of ethinylestradiol associated with gestodene or drospirenone showed no statistically significant effects on TBW or FM during one cycle of observation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Based on the document analysis method, we examined government documents produced in the last 15 years in the following dimensions: definitions of obesity, proposed actions, and strategies for linkage between sectors. In the SUS, obesity is approached as both a risk factor and a disease, with individual and social/environmental approaches aimed at changing eating practices and physical activity. In the SISAN, obesity is also conceived as a social problem involving food insecurity, and new modes of producing, marketing, and consuming foods are proposed to change eating practices in an integrated way. Proposals in the SUS point to an integrated and intra-sector approach to obesity, while those in SISAN emphasize the problem's inter-sector nature from an expanded perspective that challenges the prevailing sector-based institutional structures.},

abstract = {Obesity is an emerging condition, with a prevalence of $\sim$20%. Al though the simple measurement of BMI is likely a simplistic approach to obesity, BMI is easily calculated, and there are currently no data showing that more sophisticated methods are more useful to guide the endocrine wo rk-up in obesity. An increased BMI leads to a number of hormonal changes. Additionally, concomitant hormonal diseases can be present in obesity and have to be properly diagnosed - which in turn might be more difficult d ue to alterations caused by body fatness itself. The present European Society of Endocrinology Clinical Guidelin e on the Endocrine Work-up in Obesity acknowledges the increased prevalence of many endocrine conditi ons in obesity. It is recommended to test all patients with obesity for thyroid function, given the high prevalence of hypothyroidism in obesity. For hypercortisolism, male hypogonadism and female gonadal dysfunct ion, hormonal testing is only recommended if case of clinical suspicion of an underlying endocrine disorder. The guideline underlines that weight loss in obesity should be emphasized as key to restoration of hormonal imbalanc es and that treatment and that the effect of treating endocrine disorders on weight loss is only modest.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dandruff is a scalp disorder affecting the male populace  predominantly. Topical agents and synthetic drugs used for dandruff treatment have specific side effects including burning at the application site, depression, dizziness, headache, itching or skin rash, nausea, stomach pain, vision change, vomiting, discoloration of hair, dryness or oiliness of the scalp and increased loss of hair. Thus, essential oils and extracts from plants could be valuable in the treatment and prevention of dandruff. AIMS & OBJECTIVES: This review aims to highlight current findings in dandruff occurrence, its etiology, promising plant essential oils/extracts, and novel treatment strategies. The main emphasis has been given on the anti-dandruff effect of essential oils and plant extracts to disrupt microbial growth. The proposed mechanism(s) of action, novel approaches used to perk up its biopharmaceutical properties, and topical application have been discussed. RESULTS: The literature survey was done, and bibliographic sources and research papers were retrieved from different search engines and databases, including SciFinder, PubMed, NCBI, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The selection of papers was accomplished based on exclusion and inclusion criteria. The scalp of diverse populations revealed an association of dandruff with microbial symbiosis, including Staphylococcus, Propionibacterium, Malassezia, and Candida as the pathogens responsible for the cause of dandruff. Topical antifungals are considered the first line of treatment for dandruff including azoles, with clotrimazole (1%), ketoconazole (2%), and miconazole (2%). Other commonly used therapies integrate benzoyl peroxide, coal tar, glycerin, zinc pyrithione, lithium succinate/gluconate, salicylic acid, selenium disulfide/sulfide, sodium sulfacetamide, etc. However, these medicaments and chemicals are known to cause specific side effects. Alternative therapies, including tea tree oil, thyme, Aloe vera, Mentha have been reported to demonstrate anti-dandruff activity by disrupting the microbial growth associated with dandruff formation. CONCLUSION: Overall, this review explains the occurrence of dandruff, its pathogenesis, and the potential applicability of promising plant essential oils/extracts and their novel treatment strategies. Further studies based on pre-clinical and clinical research are essential before making any conclusion about its efficacy in humans.},

abstract = {Background: Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a widely used method for estimating body composition. Avoiding foods/beverages containing caffeine is a frequently enforced pre-test protocol to ensure reliability of BIA measurements. However, few studies have evaluated whether this is necessary, with conflicting results. We aimed to determine whether the coffee consumption differing in caffeine content influences BIA parameters in healthy adults. Methods: Twenty-five healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind cross-over trial. Three amounts of caffeine were given with 200 mL of coffee: 0 mg (11 g of decaffeinated), 200 mg (5.5 g of caffeinated plus 5.5 g of decaffeinated), and 400 mg of caffeine (11 g of caffeinated). BIA measurements were conducted at 6 different times, and coefficient variations (CV) explored. Results: No differences were observed for group × time interaction on impedance, resistance, or reactance (p > 0.05). Values of BIA parameters increased after 30-min of coffee consumption, independently of the caffeine dosage (all p < 0.001). Body fat percentage followed the same pattern and increased after 45-min (p < 0.05). Median CV for consecutive impedance, resistance, and reactance measurements were >95%CI of expected device measurement error over 70-min, without difference between groups. Urine output volume was not different between groups (decaffeinated: 440.45 ± 197.57 mL; 200 mg: 471.80 ± 171.88 mL; 400 mg: 489.30 ± 204.10 mL, p > 0.05). Conclusion: Coffee consumption influenced BIA-derived results after 70-min but was not related to caffeine content, likely due to water intake.},

The popularity and availability of the BIA study has increased in recent years. The aim of the work is to discuss its limitations, which can be divided into factors affecting the measurement of parameters and contraindications for measurements. The first group includes body structure, obesity and malnutrition, body temperature, intake of fluids and foods, changes in hydration and water and electrolyte balance, physical activity, long-term staying in a supine position, examination procedure and method of placing measuring electrodes. Contraindications include implanted cardiac devices (cardiac pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, resynchronization therapy), metal implants and pregnancy. There is no unambiguous confirmation of the validity of the mentioned contraindications in literature. Knowing the limitations of BIA is important because parts of potential errors can be avoided by properly preparing for the examination and following appropriate procedures during the measurements.},

However, the impact of food and fluid intake on measurement error has not been established. The purpose of this study was to evaluate standardised (overnight fasted, rested and hydrated) v. non-standardised (afternoon and non-fasted) presentation on technical and biological error on surface anthropometry (SA), 2C, 3C and 4C models. In thirty-two athletic males, measures of SA, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) and air displacement plethysmography (BOD POD) were taken to establish 2C, 3C and 4C models. Tests were conducted after an overnight fast (duplicate), about 7 h later after ad libitum food and fluid intake, and repeated 24 h later before and after ingestion of a specified meal. Magnitudes of changes in the mean and typical errors of measurement were determined. Mean change scores for non-standardised presentation and post meal tests for FM were substantially large in BIS, SA, 3C and 4C models. For FFM, mean change scores for non-standardised conditions produced large changes for BIS, 3C and 4C models, small for DXA, trivial for BOD POD and SA. Models that included a total body water (TBW) value from BIS (3C and 4C) were more sensitive to TBW changes in non-standardised conditions than 2C models. Biological error is minimised in all models with standardised presentation but DXA and BOD POD are acceptable if acute food and fluid intake remains below 500 g.},

abstract = {Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is the most widely used technique in body composition analysis. When we focus the use of phase sensitive BIA on its raw parameters Resistance (R), Reactance (Xc) and Phase Angle (PhA), we eliminate the bias of using predictive equations based on reference models. In particular PhA, have demonstrated their prognostic utility in multiple aspects of health and disease. In recent years, as a strong association between prognostic and diagnostic factors has been observed, scientific interest in the utility of PhA has increased. In the different fields of knowledge in biomedical research, there are different ways of assessing the impact of a scientific-technical aspect such as PhA. Single frequency with phase detection bioimpedance analysis (SF-BIA) using a 50 kHz single frequency device and tetrapolar wrist-ankle electrode placement is the most widely used bioimpedance approach for characterization of whole-body composition. However, the incorporation of vector representation of raw bioelectrical parameters and direct mathematical calculations without the need for regression equations for the analysis of body compartments has been one of the most important aspects for the development of research in this area. These results provide new evidence for the validity of phase-sensitive bioelectrical measurements as biomarkers of fluid and nutritional status. To enable the development of clinical research that provides consistent results, it is essential to establish appropriate standardization of PhA measurement techniques. Standardization of test protocols will facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of the risk associated with reduced PhA and the evaluation of changes in response to therapeutic interventions. In this paper, we describe and overview the value of PhA in biomedical research, technical and instrumental aspects of PhA research, analysis of Areas of clinical research (cancer patients, digestive and liver diseases, critical and surgical patients, Respiratory, infectious, and COVID-19, obesity and metabolic diseases, Heart and kidney failure, Malnutrition and sarcopenia), characterisation of the different research outcomes, Morphofunctional assessment in disease-related malnutrition and other metabolic disorders: validation of PhA with reference clinical practice techniques, strengths and limitations. Based on the detailed study of the measurement technique, some of the key issues to be considered in future PhA research. On the other hand, it is important to assess the clinical conditions and the phenotype of the patients, as well as to establish a disease-specific clinical profile. The appropriate selection of the most critical outcomes is another fundamental aspect of research.},

abstract = {Background: Bioelectrical impedance analysis would be a more practical tool to measure body composition in clinical settings, dietetic practice and epidemiological studies if patients/subjects did not have to fast before measurements. The present study assessed whether the ingestion of food or drink had any biologically significant effect on bioimpedance measurements and body composition by the foot-to-foot method. Methods: Fifty-five healthy adults [30 males and 25 females; mean (SD) age 27.7 (7.1) years; mean (SD)body mass index 24 (3.8) kg m-2] were randomly assigned to a 2-day food trial (high-fat meal or high-carbohydrate meal) or a 2-day drink trial (water or high electrolyte drink). Body composition measurements were carried out in the fasting state, immediately after meal consumption and every 30 min for 2 h by the foot-to-foot single frequency bioimpedance technique. Results: Bioimpedance increased significantly after the ingestion of food and fluid, although the changes were small. The electrolyte drink, high-fat and high-carbohydrate meals significantly increased the percentage body fat and fat mass. In all cases, the median percentage changes from baseline were approximately 1% in body fat percentage units. Conclusions: Although there were statistically significant changes in body composition estimates after food or drink consumption, these were small and within the imprecision of the impedance technique, and so are unlikely to be of clinical significance. The present study suggests that impedance measures of body fatness in clinical settings do not require strict adherence to fasting, and this should increase the opportunities for clinical application.},

Methods: Twenty-two women ≥60 years with a body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2 and who completed chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer were included. BIA, cardiopulmonary exercise tests and magnetic resonance imaging scans were completed before and after eight weeks of time-restricted eating. Results: At baseline, PhA was associated with cardiorespiratory fitness (R2 = 0.54, p < 0.01) and skeletal muscle volume (R2 = 0.83, p < 0.01) and myosteatosis (R2 = 0.25, p = 0.02). Results were similar at follow-up.

abstract = {Background & aims: Body composition plays a crucial role in therapy adherence and the prognosis of cancer patients. The aim of this work was to compare four measurement methods for determining body composition regarding their validity, reliability and practicability in order to be able to draft a practical recommendation as to which method is most suitable as a standard measurement method in oncology. Methods: Fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) was estimated for 100 breast cancer patients with ages of 18–70 years during a defined 20-week inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation process after primary therapy or follow-up rehabilitation. The four methods used were dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), leg-to-leg BIA and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). At baseline (t0) and after 20 weeks (t20) the agreement between the four body composition analysis methods was quantified by pairwise method comparisons using Bland–Altman bias and limits of agreement estimates, t-tests and Lin's concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs). Results: CCCs and Bland–Altman plots indicated that DXA and BIA, DXA and NIRS as well as BIA and NIRS showed an excellent agreement concerning FM estimation at both time points (CCC>0.9). In contrast, no methods agreed with a CCC higher than 0.9 with respect to FFM estimation. However, most estimates were also significantly different between two methods, except for BIA and NIRS which yielded comparable FFM and FM estimates at both time points, albeit with large 95% limits of agreement intervals. The agreement between DXA and BIA was best in the lowest BMI tertile and worsened as BMI increased. Significant differences were also found for FFM changes measured with DXA versus BIA (mean difference −0.4 kg, p = 0.0049), DXA versus to Leg-to-leg BIA (−0.6 kg, p = 0.00073) and for FM changes measured with DXA versus Leg-to-leg BIA (0.5 kg, p = 0.0011). Conclusions: For accurate and valid body composition estimates, Leg-to-leg BIA cannot be recommended due to its significant underestimation of FM or significant overestimation of FFM, respectively. BIA and NIRS results showed good agreement with the gold standard DXA. Therefore both measurement methods appear to be very well suitable to assess body composition of oncological patients and should be used more frequently on a routine basis to monitor the body composition of breast cancer patients.},

abstract = {Objective: We hypothesize that longitudinal changes in phase angle (PA) have independent associations with changes in inflammatory parameters over time and consequently with long-term survival in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of change in nutritional and inflammatory parameters over time on change in PA and on subsequent mortality in patients on MHD. Methods: A 2-y prospective longitudinal study was performed on 91 prevalent HD patients (57 men and 34 women), followed by an additional 3 y of clinical observations. Dietary intake, biochemical markers of nutrition, body composition, and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were measured at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo following enrollment. Results: In a linear mixed-effect model adjusted for baseline demographic and clinical parameters, each pg/mL increase in IL-6 over time was associated with a decrease in PA levels of 0.001°/2-y (P=0.003 for IL-6 × time interaction). PA remained associated with the rate of change in IL-6 even after controlling for extracellular water and fat mass. Changes in PA over time were associated with inverse linear changes in IL-6 (adjusted r = -0.32; P = 0.005) and consequently with mortality risk. For each 1° increase in PA, the crude and adjusted mortality hazard ratios using Cox models with effect of time-varying risk were 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.71) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.53-0.71), respectively. Additionally, longitudinal changes in PA exhibited significant associations with slopes of changes over time in main nutritional markers. Conclusions: Longitudinal changes in PA appear to be reliable in detecting changes in nutritional and inflammatory parameters over time, a combination that may contribute to the understanding of its prognostic utility. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

This study aimed to analyze the influence of pre-training levels of fat mass on body recomposition, muscular strength, and (phase angle) PhA after 24 weeks of resistance training (RT) in older women. Methods: Data from 99 older women (68.6 ± 5.7 years, 65.7 ± 8.6 kg, 155.1 ± 5.8 cm, 27.2 ± 3.1 kg/m2) was retrospectively analyzed. Participants were separated into tertiles according to the amount of fat mass at baseline as follows: low fat mass (L-FM, n = 33), moderate fat mass (M-FM, n = 33), and high fat mass (H-FM, n = 33). The participants underwent a RT program consisting of eight exercises, three sets per exercise, with a load between 8 and 15 RM, performed three times per week for 24 weeks. The SMM and fat mass were evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Body recomposition was determined by the composite Z-score of changes in SMM and fat mass. One repetition maximum (1RM) tests in chest press, knee extension, and preacher curl were assessed to verify muscular strength. Bioimpedance was used to determine phase angle. Results: Results indicated that after the RT period, a greater positive body recomposition was observed in the L-FM group than in M-FM and H-FM groups. Moreover, all groups increased muscular strength and phase angle with no significant difference among groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The present study results suggest that the initial amount of fat mass influences the body recomposition induced by RT in older women, with those with lower pre-training fat mass levels presenting higher levels of body recomposition. However, improvements in muscular strength and phase angle are not dependent on the amount of initial fat mass in older women.},

abstract = {The military are selected on the basis of physical standards and are regularly involved in strong physical activities, also related to particular sports training. The aims of the study were to analyze the effect of a 7-month military training program on body composition variables and the suitability of specific ‘bioelectrical impedance vector analysis' (spBIVA), compared to DXA, to detect the changes in body composition. A sample of 270 male Brazilian cadets (19.1 ± 1.1 years), com-posed of a group practicing military physical training routine only (MT = 155) and a group involved in a specific sport training (SMT = 115), were measured by body composition assessments (evaluated by means of DXA and spBIVA) at the beginning and the end of the military routine year. The effect of training on body composition was similar in SMT and MT groups, with an increase in LST. DXA and spBIVA were correlated, with specific resistance (Rsp) and reactance (Xcsp) positively related to fat mass (FM), FM%, LST, and lean soft tissue index (LSTI), and phase angle positively related to LST and LSTI. Body composition variations due to physical training were recognized by spBIVA: the increase in muscle mass was indicated by the phase angle and Xcsp increase, and the stability of FM% was consistent with the unchanged values of Rsp. Military training produced an increase in muscle mass, but no change in FM%, independently of the sample characteristics at baseline and the practice of additional sports. SpBIVA is a suitable technique for the assessment of body composition in military people.},

Methods: Volunteers, 98 healthy males (18.8 ± 0.5 years), had 6 months of progressive physical training (5 days a week, 90 minutes a day). Resistance, reactance, and phase angle were obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis, body composition (fat mass, bone mineral content [BMC], and lean soft tissue [LST]) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and blood glucose by reflectance photometry. Measurements were made at rest and in a fasted state, both before and after the training period. Results: Phase angle, reactance, BMC, and LST significantly increased (0.6°, 3.8 $\Omega$, 0.1 kg, and 1.9 kg, respectively; P <.01), whereas resistance and blood glucose decreased (−11.2 $\Omega$ and −4.1 mg/dL; P <.01). Changes in resistance and reactance explained those changes observed in LST (R2 =.26 and.16, respectively), but phase angle changes were not related to body composition and blood glucose alterations (P <.05). Conclusions: A 6-month period of physical training was associated with positive changes in phase angle, body composition, and blood glucose in healthy young males, reinforcing the importance of maintaining a physically active lifestyle.},

abstract = {Background: An intermission in the training routine, in which older adults refrain from regular structured exercise, may have deleterious effects on muscle performance and bioelectric phase angle (PhA), which is a predictive marker for cellular integrity. Purpose: To determine the effects of a 2-week detraining period on PhA and muscular strength (MS) in trained older adults. Methods: A total of 14 trained older adults (6 females) aged ≥65 years (77.2 ± 6.6) were assessed at baseline (i.e. trained condition) and after 2 weeks of detraining, where they refrained from their usual participation in structured exercise sessions. Whole-body resistance (R), reactance (Xc), and PhA were assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA, single frequency, 50 kHz ± 1%, NutriLab, Akern). MS was assessed on both lower and upper limbs under isometric conditions. Differences between moments were examined using ANOVA for repeated measures, while adjusting for sex. Bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA) was performed to evaluate changes in cellular function and body fluid content. Results: Detraining resulted in declines in PhA (−4.34%) (p = 0.017). There was a significant difference in the mean impedance vectors from baseline to post-detraining (p < 0.05), which were driven by decreases in reactance (Xc) relative to height (Xc/H) with little change in resistance (R) relative to height (R/H) for both males and females. No differences were found in MS for both the leg press (p = 0.992) and bench press (p = 0.166) tests. Conclusion: A detraining period as short as 2-weeks is enough to cause alterations in the bodies bioelectrical properties, resulting in detrimental changes in PhA, due to alterations in cellular integrity, but not in MS. These results highlight the importance of maintaining structured exercise sessions in older adults, and reinforce the potential role of PhA as a sensitive predictor to detect acute changes in muscle cell integrity following alterations in exercise training.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: To determine the effect of a concurrent training program on body composition and phase angle in young women. 38 women (19.26 ± 1.86 years) participated in the study, and were assigned according to convenience sampling into two groups: 11 into the control group (CG) and 27 into the intervention group (IG). The IG performed a 12-weeks concurrent training protocol. The frequency was five days a week, and the intensity was established in 40-60 % of a repetition maximum to strength exercise, and 40-65 % heart rate reserve to endurance exercise. Body composition and phase angle were evaluated by bioelectrical impedance before and after the intervention. The IG had a decrease in fat mass (pre = 24.66 ± 5.65 kg; post = 20.38 ± 4.20 kg; Cohen's d = .80; p< 0,001 [CI 95 % = 3.34,5.22]), and an increase in muscle mass (pre = 22.75 ±3.23 kg; post: 23.50± 3.41 kg; Cohen's d =-0.86; p= <0,001[CI 95 % =-1.09,-0.40]) and total phase angle (pre = 5.72{\textordmasculine} ±0.39; post: 6.24{\textordmasculine} ± 0.51; Cohen's d =-1.32; p=<0,001 [CI 95 % =-0.67,-0.36]), whereas the CG had not show significant variations in variables of body composition or total phase angle. The results suggest that a 12-weeks concurrent training program could modify positively the young women's body composition and phase angle. Hence, it is recommended using similar protocols to change variables related to young women's health.},

abstract = {This investigation aimed to compare the effects of suspension training versus traditional resistance exercise using a combination of bands and bodyweight on body composition, bioimpedance vector patterns, and handgrip strength in older men. Thirty-six older men (age 67.4 ± 5.1 years, BMI 27.1 ± 3.3 kg/m2) were randomly allocated into suspension training (n = 12), traditional training (n = 13), or non-exercise (n = 11) groups over a 12-week study period. Body composition was assessed using conventional bioelectrical impedance analysis and classic and specific bioelectric impedance vector analysis, and handgrip strength was measured with a dynamometer. Results showed a significant (p < 0.05) group by time interaction for fat mass, fat-free mass, total body water, skeletal muscle index, classic and specific bioelectrical resistance, classic bioelectrical reactance, phase angle, and dominant handgrip strength. Classic and specific vector displacements from baseline to post 12 weeks for the three groups were observed. Handgrip strength increased in the suspension training group (p < 0.01, ES: 1.50), remained stable in the traditional training group, and decreased in the control group (p < 0.01, ES: −0.86). Although bodyweight and elastic band training helps to prevent a decline in muscle mass and handgrip strength, suspension training proved more effective in counteracting the effects of aging in older men under the specific conditions studied.},

This study aimed to analyze the influence of RT on muscle architecture in older people. Methods: This PROSPERO-registered systematic review and meta-analysis (identification number CRD42022340477) followed the PRISMA guidelines. Four electronic databases were searched for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that observed older individuals submitted to RT programs that reported muscle architecture outcomes. Results: Seventeen RCTs met the eligibility criteria with a total of 488 participants. The main results of the meta-analysis showed that RT interventions had a significant effect on the thickness of the medial gastrocnemius (SMD = 0.12; 95% CI: − 0.07 to 0.17; p < 0.00001; I2 = 0%). Conclusion: Based on available evidence, studies included in this review showed improvement in maximum isometric force, pennation angle, fascicle length, thickness, and muscle activation after RT interventions. In turn, the meta-analysis suggested a potential for improving the thickness of the medial gastrocnemius after the intervention. However, any clinical implications drawn from the analyses should be interpreted with caution, as these findings are substantially limited due to a low number of included studies and a potential heterogeneity between studies.},

However, the application of a generic health-related quality of life measure for older people needs to be carefully validated. Objective: To evaluate the practicality, reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the use of the brief version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life for people aged 65 years or older. Design: A prospective study. Methods: For a baseline assessment, 1200 community-dwelling older people living in Shin-Sher Township of Taichung County, Taiwan, completed the brief version of World Health Organization Quality of Life at their residences either by themselves or with the assistance of an interviewer. Furthermore, score changes in each health-related quality of life domain after a fall were followed up for assessing its responsiveness. Results: The average length of time required to complete the questionnaire was short (10.6 minutes for self-administration and 15.3 minutes for personal interview), and the score distribution in each domain was symmetrical with no floor or ceiling effect. Furthermore, all domain scores indicated excellent discriminant validity, construct validity, and responsiveness as well as good internal consistency and intra- and inter-observer test-retest reliabilities. Nevertheless, two items related to work capacity and sexual activity had higher missing values (4.5% and 16.5%) and poor interobserver test-retest reliabilities (0.43 and 0.20). Suggested modifications to the two items for older people are discussed. Conclusion: With a few modifications, the brief World Health Organization Quality of Life is a suitable health-related quality of life instrument for older people.},

abstract = {Objectives: The present study was designed to estimate phase angle percentile curves for a broad age range of healthy individuals. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of healthy Brazilian individuals aged five to 80. InBodyS10 was used to assess phase angle. Reference curves were stratified by sex and estimated using Generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape as a continuous function of age. The phase angle determinants analyzed were physical activity, age, BMI, and SES variables. Results: Data were analyzed from 2,146 individuals, 1,189 (55.2%) of whom were female. In both sexes, the phase angles showed a similar pattern (an increasing trend from childhood to the teenage phase, followed by stabilization during adult ages and a decrease in old adults). In female, the relationship between phase angle and age were associated with BMI and family income. In the male, the relationship between phase angle and age were associated with skin color and family income. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to apply the GAMLSS technique to estimate phase angle percentiles in a healthy population covering most of the life cycle. We also showed that there are different phase angle determinants according to sex.},

abstract = {The association between early life factors and body mass index (BMI) in adulthood has been demonstrated in developed countries. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of early life factors (birth weight, gestational age, maternal smoking, and social class) on BMI in young adulthood with adjustment for adult socioeconomic position. A cohort study was carried out in 1978/79 with 6827 mother-child pairs from Ribeir{\~{a}}o Preto city, located in the most developed economic area of the country. Biological, economic and social variables and newborn anthropometric measurements were obtained shortly after delivery. In 1996, 1189 males from this cohort, 34.3% of the original male population, were submitted to anthropometric measurements and were asked about their current schooling on the occasion of army recruitment. A multiple linear regression model was applied to determine variables associated with BMI. Mean BMI was 22.7 (95%CI = 22.5-23.0). After adjustment, BMI was 1.22 kg/m2 higher among infants born with high birth weight (≥4000 g), 1.21 kg/m2 higher among individuals of low social class at birth and 0.69 kg/m2 higher among individuals whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (P < 0.05). The association between social class at birth and BMI remained statistically significant (P < 0.05) even after adjustment for adult schooling. These findings suggest that early life social influences on BMI were more important and were not reversed by late socioeconomic position. Therefore, prevention of overweight and obesity should focus not only on changes in adult life styles but also on factors such as high birth weight.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of ultrasound (US) in the quantitative assessment of steatosis by comparison with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) as a reference standard. Three liver echo-intensity indices were derived: US hepatic mean gray level, hepatic-renal echo-intensity ratio (H/R), and hepatic-portal blood echo-intensity ratio. The 1H-MRS degree of steatosis was determined as percentage fat by wet weight. Regression equations were used to estimate quantitatively hepatic fat content. The hepatic fat content by 1H-MRS analysis ranged from 0.10% to 28.9% (median value, 4.8%). Ultrasound H/R was correlated with the degree of steatosis on 1H-MRS (R2= 0.92; P < .0001), whereas no correlation with 1H-MRS was found for hepatic mean gray level and hepatic-portal blood echo-intensity ratio. A receiver operating characteristic curve identified the H/R of 2.2 as the best cutoff point for the prediction of 1H-MRS of at least 5%, yielding measures of sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 95%, respectively. In this pilot study, US H/R exhibits high sensitivity and specificity for detecting liver fatty changes. Our results indicate that quantitative evaluation of hepatic fat content can be performed using US H/R and could therefore be a valuable analytic tool in clinical investigation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Accurate measures of liver fat content are essential for investigating the role of hepatic steatosis in the pathophysiology of multiple metabolic disorders. No traditional imaging methods can accurately quantify liver fat content. 1 H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is restricted in large-scale studies because of the practical and technological issues. Previous attempts on computer-aided ultrasound quantification of liver fat content varied in method, and the ultrasound quantitative parameters measured from different ultrasound machines were hardly comparable. We aimed to establish and validate a simple and propagable method for quantitative assessment of liver fat content based on the combination of standardized ultrasound quantitative parameters, using 1 H-MRS as gold standard. Totally 127 participants were examined with both ultrasonography (US) and 1 H-MRS. Ultrasound hepatic/renal echo-intensity ratio (H/R) and ultrasound hepatic echo-intensity attenuation rate (HA) were obtained from ordinary ultrasound images using computer program. Both parameters were standardized using a tissue-mimicking phantom before analysis. Standardized ultrasound H/R and HA were positively correlated with the liver fat content by 1 H-MRS (r = 0.884, P <0.001 and r = 0.711, P <0.001, respectively). Linear regression analysis showed ultrasound H/R could modestly predict the amount of liver fat (adjusted explained variance 78.0%, P <0.001). The addition of ultrasound HA slightly improved the adjusted explained variance to 79.8%. Difference of estimated liver fat contents between different ultrasound machines and operators was reasonably well. Thus, computer-aided US is a valid method to estimate liver fat content and can be applied extensively after standardization of ultrasound quantitative parameters. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Obesity Society.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE. Quantification of liver steatosis is clinically relevant in various liver diseases but cannot be done by conventional sonography, which only provides a qualitative assessment with significant observer variability. The aim of this study was to assess sonography as an objective tool for the quantification of liver steatosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Files of 111 patients with chronic liver disease who were referred for sonographically guided liver biopsy were collected. A hepatorenal sonographic index was calculated on the basis of the ratio between the echogenicity of the liver and that of the right kidney cortex using histogram echo intensity. Liver steatosis was graded by histology. RESULTS. A significant correlation was found between histologic steatosis and the hepatorenal sonographic index (r = 0.82,p < 0.001). The validity of the hepatorenal sonographic index for the diagnosis of fatty liver was compared with liver biopsies with a steatosis level > 5%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 99.2% (95% CI, 98-100%). The optimal hepatorenal sonographic index cutoff point for the prediction of steatosis > 5% was 1.49, with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91%. The optimal hepatorenal sonographic index cutoff point for the prediction of steatosis ≥ 25% was 1.86, with sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 90%. The optimal hepatorenal sonographic index cutoff point for the prediction of steatosis ≥ 60% was 2.23, with sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 93%. CONCLUSION. The hepatorenal sonographic index is a sensitive noninvasive method for steatosis quantification. It can diagnose small amounts of liver fat that would be missed by conventional sonography. It is reproducible and operator independent and can serve as an efficient tool to follow patients with steatosis and evaluate the efficacy of new treatment techniques. {\textcopyright} American Roentgen Ray Society.},

abstract = {Purpose. To evaluate the accuracy of the sonographic hepatorenal ratio (HRR) in the diagnosis and grading of nonalcoholic steatosis, using biopsy as the reference. Methods. Ultrasound (US) and liver biopsy were performed in 42 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Forty healthy volunteers without steatosis at US and without risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were also studied. The HRR was obtained by dividing the mean brightness level of region-of-interest pixels in hepatic parenchyma by that in renal parenchyma. Needle biopsy samples (hematoxylin-eosin stained) were classified as mild (5-33% fatty infiltration), moderate (>33-66%), or severe (>66%) steatosis. Spearman coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between HRR and steatosis grade, analysis of variance for differences between subgroups, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for sensitivity and specificity. Results. Significant correlation was found between HRR and histologic steatosis (r = 0.80, p < 0.01). The HRR cutoff for predicting steatosis was ≥1.24 (sensitivity, 92.7%; specificity, 92.5%). The mean ± SD HRRs in controls and steatosis subgroups were control 1.09 ± 0.13, mild 1.46 ± 0.24, moderate 1.52 ± 0.27, severe 2.04 ± 0.3 and were significantly different from each other except between mild and moderate steatosis subgroups. Conclusions. The HRR is a noninvasive, objective, and simple method that could be used to diagnose and grade hepatic steatosis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was percentage change in body weight, and confirmatory secondary end points were achievement of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss, assessed for semaglutide vs liraglutide at week 68. Semaglutide vs liraglutide comparisons were open-label, with active treatment groups double-blinded against matched placebo groups. Comparisons of active treatments vs pooled placebo were supportive secondary end points. Results: Of 338 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 49 [13] years; 265 women [78.4%]; mean [SD] body weight, 104.5 [23.8] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 37.5 [6.8]), 319 (94.4%) completed the trial, and 271 (80.2%) completed treatment. The mean weight change from baseline was -15.8% with semaglutide vs -6.4% with liraglutide (difference, -9.4 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -6.8]; P <.001); weight change with pooled placebo was -1.9%. Participants had significantly greater odds of achieving 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss with semaglutide vs liraglutide (70.9% of participants vs 25.6% [odds ratio, 6.3 {95% CI, 3.5 to 11.2}], 55.6% vs 12.0% [odds ratio, 7.9 {95% CI, 4.1 to 15.4}], and 38.5% vs 6.0% [odds ratio, 8.2 {95% CI, 3.5 to 19.1}], respectively; all P <.001). Proportions of participants discontinuing treatment for any reason were 13.5% with semaglutide and 27.6% with liraglutide. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by 84.1% with semaglutide and 82.7% with liraglutide. Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, added to counseling for diet and physical activity, resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 68 weeks.

abstract = {Background: Despite common mechanisms of actions, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists differ in structure, pharmacokinetic profile, and clinical effects. This head-to-head trial compared semaglutide with dulaglutide in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. Methods: This was an open-label, parallel-group, phase 3b trial done at 194 hospitals, clinical institutions or private practices in 16 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had type 2 diabetes with HbA1c 7{\textperiodcentered}0–10{\textperiodcentered}5% (53{\textperiodcentered}0–91{\textperiodcentered}0 mmol/mol) on metformin monotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) by use of an interactive web-response system to once a week treatment with either semaglutide 0{\textperiodcentered}5 mg, dulaglutide 0{\textperiodcentered}75 mg, semaglutide 1{\textperiodcentered}0 mg, or dulaglutide 1{\textperiodcentered}5 mg subcutaneously. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in percentage HbA1c; the confirmatory secondary endpoint was change in bodyweight, both at week 40. The primary analysis population included all randomly assigned patients exposed to at least one dose of trial product obtained while on treatment and before the onset of rescue medication. The safety population included all randomly assigned patients exposed to at least one dose of trial product obtained while on treatment. The trial was powered for HbA1c non-inferiority (margin 0{\textperiodcentered}4%) and bodyweight superiority. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02648204. Findings: Between Jan 6, 2016, and June 22, 2016, 1201 patients were randomly assigned to treatment; of these, 301 were exposed to semaglutide 0{\textperiodcentered}5 mg, 299 to dulaglutide 0{\textperiodcentered}75 mg, 300 to semaglutide 1{\textperiodcentered}0 mg, and 299 to dulaglutide 1{\textperiodcentered}5 mg. 72 (6%) patients withdrew from the trial (22 receiving semaglutide 0{\textperiodcentered}5 mg, 13 receiving dulaglutide 0{\textperiodcentered}75 mg, 21 receiving semaglutide 1{\textperiodcentered}0 mg, and 16 receiving dulaglutide 1{\textperiodcentered}5 mg). From overall baseline mean, mean percentage HbA1c was reduced by 1{\textperiodcentered}5 (SE 0{\textperiodcentered}06) percentage points with semaglutide 0{\textperiodcentered}5 mg versus 1{\textperiodcentered}1 (0{\textperiodcentered}05) percentage points with dulaglutide 0{\textperiodcentered}75 mg (estimated treatment difference [ETD] −0{\textperiodcentered}40 percentage points [95% CI −0{\textperiodcentered}55 to −0{\textperiodcentered}25]; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and by 1{\textperiodcentered}8 (0{\textperiodcentered}06) percentage points with semaglutide 1{\textperiodcentered}0 mg versus 1{\textperiodcentered}4 (0{\textperiodcentered}06) percentage points with dulaglutide 1{\textperiodcentered}5 mg (ETD −0{\textperiodcentered}41 percentage points [–0{\textperiodcentered}57 to −0{\textperiodcentered}25]; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001). From overall baseline mean, mean bodyweight was reduced by 4{\textperiodcentered}6 kg (SE 0{\textperiodcentered}28) with semaglutide 0{\textperiodcentered}5 mg compared with 2{\textperiodcentered}3 kg (0{\textperiodcentered}27) with dulaglutide 0{\textperiodcentered}75 mg (ETD −2{\textperiodcentered}26 kg [–3{\textperiodcentered}02 to −1{\textperiodcentered}51]; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and by 6{\textperiodcentered}5 kg (0{\textperiodcentered}28) with semaglutide 1{\textperiodcentered}0 mg compared with 3{\textperiodcentered}0 kg (0{\textperiodcentered}27) with dulaglutide 1{\textperiodcentered}5 mg (ETD −3{\textperiodcentered}55 kg [–4{\textperiodcentered}32 to −2{\textperiodcentered}78]; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported adverse event, occurring in 129 (43%) of 301 patients receiving semaglutide 0{\textperiodcentered}5 mg, 133 (44%) of 300 patients receiving semaglutide 1{\textperiodcentered}0 mg, 100 (33%) of 299 patients receiving dulaglutide 0{\textperiodcentered}75 mg, and in 143 (48%) of 299 patients receiving dulaglutide 1{\textperiodcentered}5 mg. Gastrointestinal disorders were also the most common reason for discontinuing treatment with semaglutide and dulaglutide. There were six fatalities: one in each semaglutide group and two in each dulaglutide group. Interpretation: At low and high doses, semaglutide was superior to dulaglutide in improving glycaemic control and reducing bodyweight, enabling a significantly greater number of patients with type 2 diabetes to achieve clinically meaningful glycaemic targets and weight loss, with a similar safety profile.

abstract = {Aim: To evaluate the impact of dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg versus 1.5 mg on body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) based on exploratory analyses of the AWARD-11 trial. Materials and Methods: Patients were randomized to once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 (n = 612), 3.0 (n = 616) or 4.5 mg (n = 614) for 52 weeks. The primary objective was superiority of dulaglutide 3.0 and/or 4.5 mg over 1.5 mg in HbA1c reduction at 36 weeks. Secondary and exploratory assessments included weight reduction in the overall trial population and baseline body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c subgroups. Results: At baseline, patients had a mean age of 57.1 years, HbA1c 8.6% (70 mmol/mol), weight 95.7 kg and BMI 34.2 kg/m2. At 36 weeks, dulaglutide 3.0 and 4.5 mg were superior to 1.5 mg for weight change from baseline (1.5 mg, −3.1 kg; 3.0 mg, −4.0 kg [P =.001]; 4.5 mg, −4.7 kg [P <.001]). Higher dulaglutide doses were associated with numerically greater weight reduction compared with 1.5 mg in each baseline BMI and HbA1c subgroup. Absolute weight reduction increased with increasing BMI category, but percentage weight loss was similar between subgroups. Weight reductions with dulaglutide were greater in patients with lower versus higher baseline HbA1c. Conclusions: In patients with T2D, inadequately controlled by metformin, incremental weight loss was observed with dulaglutide 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 mg doses regardless of baseline BMI or HbA1c. Although absolute weight loss was numerically greater in patients with higher baseline BMI, percentage of weight loss was similar between BMI subgroups.},

abstract = {Aims: Currently, no head-to-head data are available comparing semaglutide 2.0 mg with dulaglutide 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg. We conducted an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of their effects on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes. Materials and methods: Multilevel network meta-regression was conducted, based on a connected evidence network of published results from the A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Dulaglutide (LY2189265) in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes 11 trial and individual patient data from the A Research Study to Compare Two Doses of Semaglutide Taken Once Weekly in People With Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) and SUSTAIN 7 trials. Results: Semaglutide 2.0 mg significantly reduced HbA1c vs dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg, with estimated treatment differences (ETDs) of -0.44% points (95% credible interval [CrI], -0.68 to -0.19) and -0.28% points (95% CrI, -0.52 to -0.03), respectively. Semaglutide 2.0 mg also significantly reduced body weight vs dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg with ETDs of -3.29 kg (95% CrI, -4.62 to -1.96) and -2.57 kg (95% CrI, -3.90 to -1.24), respectively. Odds of achieving HbA1c<7.0% were significantly greater for semaglutide 2.0 vs dulaglutide 3.0 mg (odds ratio [OR]: 2.23 [95% CrI, 1.15-3.90]), whereas this did not reach significance for semaglutide 2.0 mg vs dulaglutide 4.5 mg (OR: 1.58 [95% CrI, 0.82-2.78]). Sensitivity analyses supported the main analysis findings. Conclusions: This ITC demonstrated significantly greater reductions from baseline in HbA1c and body weight with semaglutide 2.0 mg vs dulaglutide 3.0 mg and 4.5 mg. The findings of this study provide important comparative effectiveness information until randomized head-to-head studies become available.},

Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed. METHODS In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (≥27 in persons with ≥1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions. RESULTS The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -13.4 to -11.5; P<0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P<0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95% CI, -13.7 to -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]). CONCLUSIONS In participants with overweight or obesity, 2.4 mg of semaglutide once weekly plus lifestyle intervention was associated with sustained, clinically relevant reduction in body weight.

METHODS In this double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled adolescents (12 to <18 years of age) with obesity (a body-mass index [BMI] in the 95th percentile or higher) or with overweight (a BMI in the 85th percentile or higher) and at least one weight-related coexisting condition. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo for 68 weeks, plus lifestyle intervention. The primary end point was the percentage change in BMI from baseline to week 68; the secondary confirmatory end point was weight loss of at least 5% at week 68. RESULTS A total of 201 participants underwent randomization, and 180 (90%) completed treatment. All but one of the participants had obesity. The mean change in BMI from baseline to week 68 was -16.1% with semaglutide and 0.6% with placebo (estimated difference, -16.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -20.3 to -13.2; P<0.001).

Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, has been shown to have potential benefit for weight management at a once-daily dose of 3.0 mg, injected subcutaneously. Methods We conducted a 56-week, double-blind trial involving 3731 patients who did not have type 2 diabetes and who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of at least 30 or a BMI of at least 27 if they had treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension. We randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide at a dose of 3.0 mg (2487 patients) or placebo (1244 patients); both groups received counseling on lifestyle modification. The coprimary end points were the change in body weight and the proportions of patients losing at least 5% and more than 10% of their initial body weight. Results At baseline, the mean (±SD) age of the patients was 45.1±12.0 years, the mean weight was 106.2±21.4 kg, and the mean BMI was 38.3±6.4; a total of 78.5% of the patients were women and 61.2% had prediabetes. At week 56, patients in the liraglutide group had lost a mean of 8.4±7.3 kg of body weight, and those in the placebo group had lost a mean of 2.8±6.5 kg (a difference of -5.6 kg; 95% confidence interval, -6.0 to -5.1; P<0.001, with last-observation-carried-forward imputation). A total of 63.2% of the patients in the liraglutide group as compared with 27.1% in the placebo group lost at least 5% of their body weight (P<0.001), and 33.1% and 10.6%, respectively, lost more than 10% of their body weight (P<0.001). The most frequently reported adverse events with liraglutide were mild or moderate nausea and diarrhea. Serious events occurred in 6.2% of the patients in the liraglutide group and in 5.0% of the patients in the placebo group.

abstract = {Background: The phase angle (PA) has been used as a prognostic marker in several clinical situations. Nevertheless, its biological meaning is not completely understood. Objective: We verified how body-composition components could explain the PA. Design: The trial was a cross-sectional study involving 1442 participants (women: 58.5%; Caucasian: 40.2%) from body-composition studies. Labeled tritium dilution and total-body potassium were used to estimate total-body water (TBW) and intracellular water (ICW), respectively. Extracellular water (ECW) and the ECW:ICW ratio were estimated from the difference and the ratio of these values. Fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) were estimated with the use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, underwater weighing (UWW), and TBW. The PA was estimated with the use of a single-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis system. Correlations between the PA and all body-composition variables were evaluated. A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to adjust for the effects of body-composition variables on the PA variability. All analyses were performed separately by sex. Results: Compared with men, women exhibited significantly larger ECW:ICW ratios and FM. The highest positive correlation was shown between the PA and FFM obtained with the use of UWW (both sexes). The highest negative correlation was shown between the PA and ECW: ICW ratios for both sexes. Age, race, height, ECW:ICW, and FFM from UWW were significant PA determinants in a multivariate linear regression model. Even after adjustment for all significant covariates, the explained PA variance was low (adjusted R2 = 0.539 and 0.421 in men and women, respectively). The greatest impact on the total PA prediction in both men and women were age, FFM, and height. Conclusions: Age is the most significant PA predictor in men and women followed by FFM and height. The ECW:ICW contribution may explain the association of the PA observed in the clinical setting and in people who are obese.},

Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to determine BMI and phase angle independent associations with DMS. Results: Malnutrition risk (DMS > 13) showed a gradual increase among patients with normal BMI and phase angle (44.4%), low BMI (45.8%), low phase angle (64.0%), and in those with both parameters at abnormal ranges (68.0%). The phase angle was the only variable that was independently associated with patient nutritional status (standardized coefficient beta −0.372, p < 0.001), accounting for 13.8% of DMS variation. Conclusion: Phase angle is inversely and independently associated with malnutrition risk in patients with ESRD, which suggests that BIA-assessed body composition might be better than BMI in the clinical assessment of patients with ESRD.},

abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer diagnosed among women worldwide. Phase angle (PhA), a proxy measure of membrane integrity and function, has gained relevance in clinical practice and it has been suggested to be a prognostic and nutritional indicator. This systematic review aimed to explore PhA and its relationship with nutritional status and survival in BC patients. Four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CINAHL) were systematically searched until September 2021 for studies evaluating PhA in BC patients. A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria, where 11 were observational studies and 5 were interventional studies. Baseline PhA-value varied from 4.9 to 6.30 degrees, showing a great variability and heterogeneity across the selected studies. Available data suggested that PhA decreased by 5–15% after completing chemotherapy, and those effects might persist in the long term. However, the use of tailored nutritional and/or exercise programs during and after therapy could prevent PhA reduction and body derangement. High PhA values were found in women displaying a better nutritional status, while inconsistent data were found on survival. Therefore, further studies are needed to focus on the clinical relevance of PhA in BC patients, evaluating its association with disease outcomes and survival.},

Several studies show that the phase angle (PhA), a bioimpedance analysis (BIA) parameter, is very sensitive to assess a nutritional status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the variation of BC, PhA, before and two years after gastric bypass surgery in group of women with severe obesity. Methods: Twelve women aged 36.1±11.3 yrs, weight 131.2±19.4 kg, height 165.3±5.4 cm, BMI 47.9±6.7 kg/m2) were recruited for the study. BC and the measure of PhA were bioimpedance analysis (BIA) performed at 50 kHz (DS Medica). Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (Version 24.0, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Results: BC, before surgery, was: Free Fat Mass (FFM) Free Fat Mass (FFM) 63.4±6.5 kg, Fat Mass (FM) 67.8±14.1 kg, FM expressed in percent 51.2±3.61 %; after two years FFM decreased significantly ( -10.2±4.71 kg, FM -32.6±13.9 kg e and % of FM -24.4±8.4%). Two years after surgery body weight and BMI decreased (- 42.9±17.7 kg and - 16.6±6.1 kg/m2) respectively Also, the PhA decreased by -1.2±1.3° (before the surgery the value was 6.8 ±1.1°). Conclusions: Our preliminary findings show after 2 years the relationship between weight loss and changes in body composition, observed a marked reduction in FM (75% of body weight loss) with a good preservation of FFM. PhA is reduced significantly underlining a worsening of nutritional status and highlighting the relevance of a close nutritional follow-up following bariatric surgery.},

abstract = {Context The ability to predict survival accurately has implications in clinical decision making. Objectives We determined the association of phase angle obtained from multi-frequency bioelectric impedance analysis with overall survival in patients with advanced cancer. Methods We included consecutive patients with advanced cancer who had an outpatient palliative care consultation. Multi-frequency bioelectric impedance analysis assessed phase angle at three different frequencies (5/50/250 kHz) on each hemibody (right/left). Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results Among 366 patients, the median overall survival was 250 days (95% confidence interval 191–303 days). The mean phase angle for 5, 50, and 250 kHz were 2.2°, 4.4°, and 4.2° on the right and 2.0°, 4.2° and 4.1° on the left, respectively. For all six phase angles, a lower value was significantly associated with a poorer overall survival (P < 0.001). After adjusting for cancer type, performance status, weight loss, and inflammatory markers, phase angle remained independently associated with overall survival (hazard ratio 0.85 per degree increase, 95% confidence interval 0.72–0.99; P = 0.048). Conclusion Phase angle represents a novel objective prognostic factor in outpatient palliative cancer care setting, regardless of frequency and body sides.},

abstract = {Introduction: Phase angle is the ratio between cell mass and fat-free tissue and a cell health indicator which is measurable through bio-impedance analysis with 50 KHZ alternating current and can be interpreted as a voltage and a wave-form current. Diabetes mellitus contains a group of metabolic disorders that are in common in terms of appearance characteristic of hyperglycemia. Micro-albuminuria of urine albumin amounts 30-300mg/24h and the higher values are for diagnostic diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between Phase angle and micro-albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients with a history of more than 5 years of the disease in the city of Ilam. Materials and methods: This is an analytical-practical case-control study and statistical society includes two case and control groups with an average age 52.06±6.69 years in case group and 50.02±5.42 years in the control group. The sample size in each group has been designated equal to 50 and data analysis is performed using SPSS and parametric and Non-parametric statistical methods and the related tests. Conclusion: The average Ph.A was obtained equal to 5.87±1.42 in the case group and 7.29±0.355 in the control group which statistically significant relationship exists between the two groups in Ph.A value (P < 0.000). Average micro-albuminuria was 67.32±75.92 in the case group and 0.276±0.147 in the control group which there was a significant relationship statistically between the amount of micro-albuminuria within the both groups (P < 0.000). Discussion: By investigation of the relationship between ph.Angle and micro-albuminuria in diabetic patients it can be concluded that the amount Ph.A reduces with the increase of micro-albuminuria and by increasing micro-albuminuria, the variables of overall body water volume, intracellular water and extracellular water relatively increase and fat mass relatively decreases.},

abstract = {Introduction Malnutrition is an important determinant of ICU outcome. An objective way to measure body composition and malnutrition is by bio-impedance analysis and calculation of phase angle (PhA). We questioned whether malnutrition, according to PhA, is associated with morbidity and mortality after ICU admission. Methods During 15 weeks consecutive patients were included. Exclusion criteria were age < 18 years, abnormalities of the limbs and ICU stay < 6 hours. PhA was measured short after admission, a PhA < 5 ° for men and < 4.6° for women was considered malnutrition. Demographic and clinical variables were collected. The study was approved by our ethical committee (nWMO 77, 2015). Results: 299 Patients were included. Malnutrition was established in 36% (n = 106). Patients with malnutrition were more often female, older, with lower BMI and higher APACHE II score (Table 11) and more often di-agnosed with a malignancy (30 vs 14%, p < 0.001). Hospital LOS, ICU and hospital mortality were higher in patients with a low PhA. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant relation between PhA and age, sex, BMI, malignant disease, hospital LOS and hospital mortality. Conclusions According to PhA, malnutrition was present in 36% of ICU patients. The same independent predictors of PhA (age, sex and BMI) were found as in a general hospital population. Even in this small population of a mixed ICU patients, a low phase angle was found to independently predict hospital mortality. The value of phase angle for ICU patients warrants more research.},

Observation of this cohort was continued over 3 additional years. Longitudinally, 1O increase in PA over time, controlling for demographic and clinical parameters, was associated with a delay in longitudinal elevation of IL-6 (linear estimate: -2.11 (95% CI: -3.47; -0.75) pg/ml/mo; p=0.002 for PA X Time interaction). A decrease or increase in PA over time was associated with inverse linear changes in IL-6 levels (adjusted r=-0.305, p=0.005) and correspondingly with higher or lower death risk. For each 1O increase in PA, the crude and adjusted mortality hazard ratios using Cox models with effect of time varying risk were 0.62 (95% CI: 0.54; 0.71) and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.53; 0.71), respectively. In conclusion, longitudinal changes in PA appeared to be reliable in detecting changes in nutritional and inflammatory parameters over time - combination that may contribute to understanding of its prognostic bearing.},

Methods: This is a longitudinal research carried out at Instituto Alfa de Gastroenterologia from a University Hospital. Thirteen patients (age 62.6±12.8 years, 8 men and 5 women) with cancer of the head, neck as well as gastrointestinal lesions, admitted for surgery, from December 2012 to March 2013, were included. They were assessed by bioelectric impedance analysis and anthropometric measurements at two moments: the first-twenty-four hours preoperatively (T0), and second-between the first and second postoperative day (T1). The phase angle (PA) was calculated using the formula provided by BIA RJL and was corrected by total body water (TBW). Furthermore data concerning clinical history were evaluated. Results: BMI were statistically different at T0 and T1 (p < 0.001) while no differences were observed in arm circumference and triceps skinfold.

Phase angle, derived from bio-impedance analysis, reflects tissue quality and quantity in which cell mass, membrane integrity and hydration state are represented. We hypothesized that phase angle on ICU admission may serve as a proxy for physical frailty and as such can be used as an additional predictor of long-term mortality after ICU admission. Methods: A single-center prospective observational cohort study with consecutive patients, admitted to the ICU between June 2018 and June 2019. Demographic data, APACHE III, comorbidity, and phase angle in the first 6 h after ICU admission were collected and the ICU, hospital, and 1-year survival were registered. Results: Of all 1023 patients, 115 (11%) died within a year after ICU admission. Nonsurvivors had higher APACHE III scores than survivors [86 (65–119) vs. 55 (46–67), p < 0.001]. Phase angle was significantly higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors [5.4 (4.7–6.4) vs. 4.7 (3.9–6.0), p < 0.001]. Univariate analysis showed an association between mortality and admission type, sepsis, presence of malignancy, APACHE III, and PhA. Multivariate logistic regression analysis using these variables confirmed low PhA to be an independent predictor of 1-year mortality (OR: 1.81; CI: 1.09–2.97; p = 0.02), in addition to presence of malignancy (OR: 2.30; CI: 1.31–4.02; p = 0.004) and APACHE III score (OR: 1.03; CI: 1.02–1.04; p < 0.001).

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Teaching Hospital. Participants: 1085 individuals aged 55 years or over. Measurements: Phase Angle was obtained using bioimpedance analysis with the Bodystat QuadScan{\textregistered} 4000. Diabetes mellitus was considered present with fasting hyperglycaemia (serum fasting glucose >6.66 mmol/l), HbA1c > 42 mmol/mol (6.1%), or self-reported Diabetes or the consumption of glucose-lowering agents. Results: The mean age of the (standard deviation) of the 1,085 participants was 68.11 (7.12) years and 60.7% were women. Among male participants, individuals with PhA within the lowest quartile (PhA ≤4.9) were significantly more likely to have diabetes mellitus [odds Ratio (95% confidence interval, CI), 2.02 (1.17–3.47)] following adjustments for age, body mass index and other comorbidities. The above relationship was attenuated following further adjustment hypoglycaemic medications. Men on oral hypoglycaemic agents had significantly reduced PhA [mean difference (95% CI), −0.44 (−0.67 to −0.22)]. No significant relationship between PhA and diabetes existed among women. Conclusion: The association between lower PhA (≤4.9) in men aged 55 and over and diabetes which is accounted for by oral hypoglycaemic agents. The mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. This relationship should also be evaluated further to determine the potential of PhA as a prognostic tool for diabetes.},

What precisely is meant by this term is not always clear but strong relationships have been found between cellular water status (the relative amounts of extra- and intracellular water), cell membrane integrity and cellular mass. Much of the current research is empirical observation and frequently pays little regard to the underlying biophysical models that underpin the BIA technique or attempts to provide mechanistic explanations for the observations. This brief review seeks to provide a basic understanding of the electrical models frequently used to describe the passive electrical properties of tissues with particular focus on phase angle. In addition, it draws attention to some practical concerns in the measurement of phase angle and notes the additional understanding that can be gained when phase angle are obtained with bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) rather than single frequency BIA (SFBIA) along with the potential for simulation modelling.},

Parameters: PA assessed by tetrapolar multifrequency bioimpedance analysis (Biodynamics 450{\textregistered}, Seattle, USA) further compared with age/sex reference percentiles; muscle mass, assessed by Computed Tomography (n = 35); dietary intake, assessed by 24-hour recall. Food data were analysed by Food Processor SQL{\textregistered} software to obtain detailed daily nutrient intake, that were compared with estimated energy requirements (WHO formulas) and Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). Results: We found a deficit of energy and protein intake in ∼35% of pts. Fat intake was higher than the maximum recommended in 50% of pts, reaching 38% of their total energy intake (TEI); 40% of pts consumed excessive saturated fat (15±2% of TEI), concomitantly with deficient intake of polyunsaturated fats (5±1% of TEI). In most patients, intake of vitamins E & C was below DRIs. A PA< 5th percentile was associated with decreased energy & protein intakes (p < 0.02), and 55% of pts with low PA had excessive body fat (p < 0.05). Conclusion: More than 1/3 of patients had low energy/protein intake and inadequate diet pattern, excessive in total & saturated fats & poor in essential fatty acids & micronutrients. PA, an indicator of membrane integrity & metabolic efficiency, was associated with dietary deficits and inadequate body composition. These preliminary data support the continuation of this study, allowing further in-depth analyses in a larger cohort to explore the role of dietary components & nutrients in modulating cell membrane integrity & body composition. These results may be crucial to optimize the potential for favorable treatment response & efficacy.},

abstract = {Introduction: Phase angle, derived from bioimpedance analysis (BIA), reflects tissue quality and quantity in which cell mass, membrane integrity and hydration state are represented. Phase angle, as a measure of body composition, changes with the physical condition of patients and is associated with survival in several disease states and during ICU admission. We questioned whether phase angle can be used as a predictor of long term ICU outcome. Methods: A single-center prospective observational cohort with consecutive patients, admitted to the ICU between June 2018 and June 2019. Demographic data, APACHE III, comorbidity and phase angle in the first 6 hours after ICU admission were collected and the ICU-, hospital- and 6 months survival were registered. Results: Of 1025 patients included 8.5% (87) died within 6 months after ICU admission. Patients who died had a higher APACHE III score (95 [71- 128] versus 56 [46-68] p<0.001), and more often sepsis or malignancy. The phase angle was lower among non survivors (4.9° [4.0- 5.9] versus 5.4° [4.7-6.4] p< 0.001). The cut-off value for the phase angle, determined with the ROC is 4.6°. The Kaplan Meier curve (Figure 1) showed a significant difference (Log rank p<0.001) in mortality between patients with a phase angle beneath 4.6°. Conclusions: A low phase angle at time of ICU admission is a predictor of long term survival, with an optimal cut-off value of 4.6°.(Table Presented).},

abstract = {Phase angle (PA) is a ratio between the reactance and resistance obtained by bioelectric impedance analysis and has been interpreted as a cell membrane integrity indicator and a predictor of total body cell mass. A low PA may suggest deterioration of the cell membrane, which in advanced cancer patients may result in a reduced overall survival (OS). This systematic review sought to investigate the current evidence regarding whether there is an association between PA and OS in patients with advanced cancer (ie, metastatic disease). The search was conducted on electronic databases in August 2017. A total of 34 articles were identified in the initial literature search. Nine studies reporting on 1496 patients were deemed eligible according to our inclusion criteria. PA data were analyzed as continuous variables or according to different cutoffs, under a frequency of 50 Khz. Low PA was associated with worse nutrition status evaluated by body mass index, serum albumin level, transferrin, and fat-free mass. The median OS of the included papers varied from 25.5–330 days, and all studies analyzed showed a significant association between PA and OS, in that patients with low PA had worse OS. Future studies are necessary to justify the use of PA in therapeutic decisions for this population and to evaluate whether nutrition status can influence the association between PA and survival.},

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: The PA parameter, obtained by BIA, as a reflection of body cell mass, tissue hydration, and membrane integrity, is a useful tool for identifying dialysis patients at high risk for malnutrition, a condition associated with high mortality in these patients. Also, elevated serum Ca (sCa) levels and treatment with high DCa (HDCa), both associated with an increased risk of Ca overload, have been linked with morbidity and mortality. In this study, we aimed to investigate the associations between DCa treatment and nutritional status, and specifically to explore the possibility whether treatment with a HDCa is causally associated with a low PA, indicative of malnutrition. Methods: A 18-month prospective longitudinal study was performed on 45 HD and 49 PD patients, with an additional follow-up period of 2.5 years. Biochemical markers of nutrition and body composition were measured at baseline, 6 and 18 months following enrollment. Half of the patients (n=47) were treated with a low DCa of 1.25 mmol/L (LDCa) and the other half (n=47) were treated with a HDCa of 1.75 mmol/L. DCa prescription remained constant during the whole study period. Results: In a linear mixed-effect model adjusted for age, dialysis vintage, cardiovascular disease and diabetes at baseline, gender, mode of dialysis and sCa, PA changes were inversely related to DCa concentration (r adjusted = -0.57; p<0.001) and linear changes of sCa (r adjusted = -0.10; p<0.05). PA levels decreased over time ( p<0.05) and treatment with a HDCa was associated with a decrease in PA levels of 0.15°/1.5 years (p = 0.005 for DCa × time interaction). During the 4-year follow-up, there were 24 deaths. In a Cox model , adjusted to the same covariates as mentioned above, the use of HDCa was significantly associated with a 3-fold increased all-cause mortality risk (HR: 3.06; 95% CI, 1.07-8.7), whereas, for each 1° increment of PA there was a significant 40% reduced risk for all-cause mortality (HR: 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.92). Conclusions: This is the first study to show that the use of a HDCa is causally related to low Pa levels over time, thus identifying HDCa as a new inducer of malnutrition. The mechanisms underlying this association, which are independent of increased sCa levels, remain to be elucidated. Apart from being a significant predictor of malnutrition, a HDCa also constitutes a strong and independent risk factor for mortality, and thus, the use of DCa as high as 1.75 mmol/L should be strictly avoided and a LDCa be used instead.},

abstract = {Background: Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a validated method to assess body composition in persons with fluid homeostasis and reliable body weight. This is not the case during critical illness. The raw BIA markers resistance, reactance, phase angle, and vector length are body weight independent. Phase angle reflects cellular health and has prognostic significance. We aimed to assess the course of phase angle and vector length during intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and determine the relation between their changes ($\Delta$) and changes in body hydration. Methods: A prospective, dual-center observational study of adult ICU patients was conducted. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed, including reactance as a marker of cellular mass and integrity and total body water according to the Biasioli equation (TBWBiasioli) and fluid balance as body weight independent markers of hydration. Results: One hundred and fifty-six ICU patients (mean ± SD age 62.5 ± 14.5 years, 67% male) were included. Between days 1 and 3, there was a significant decrease in reactance/m (−2.6 ± 6.0 $\Omega$), phase angle (−0.4 ± 1.1°), and vector length (−12.2 ± 44.3 $\Omega$/m). Markers of hydration significantly increased. $\Delta$phase angle and $\Delta$vector length were both positively related to $\Delta$reactance/m (r2 = 0.55, p ' 0.01; r2 = 0.38, p ' 0.01). Adding $\Delta$TBWBiasioli as explaining factor strongly improved the association between $\Delta$phase angle and $\Delta$reactance/m (r2 = 0.73, p ' 0.01), and $\Delta$vector length and $\Delta$reactance/m (r2 = 0.77, p ' 0.01). Conclusions: Our results show that during critical illness, changes in phase angle and vector length partially reflect changes in hydration.},

Phase angle measurement by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is an indicator of cellular health and muscle mass. We aimed to investigate how muscle mass and phase angle are related to LS risk stage. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 311 patients who were undergoing a health checkup. All participants performed the two-step test, stand-up test, and 25-question geriatric locomotive function scale components of the LS risk test. Muscle mass and phase angle were measured using BIA. A comparison study was conducted among the three LS risk stages. Results: In the trend test, phase angle decreased significantly as the LS risk stage progressed, whereas muscle mass did not show a significant difference. After adjusting for age and sex, phase angle showed a significant difference among all LS risk stages. Muscle mass did not show a significant difference between no risk and stage 1. Conclusion: Compared to muscle mass, phase angle more strongly reflects LS risk and becomes significantly reduced at later LS risk stages. Phase angle can be a useful screening tool for LS risk.},

abstract = {Segmental multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (s-MFBIA) has been adopted recently to evaluate the volume of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). This procedure uses the segmental phase angle (s-PhA) as an indicator of cellular integrity. In the smaller-built Asian population, the BCRL often has a small volume difference and can be overlooked by tape circumference volume measurement (TVM). This study aimed to investigate the clinical feasibility of s-MFBIA for the assessment of lymphedema severity compared with TVM and evaluate the association between lymphedema severity and cellular integrity of the affected arm based on s-PhA values for a patient with mild- to moderate-degree BCRL. Segmental PhA and extracellular water (ECW)/total body water (TBW) ratio of bilateral arms were measured using InBody S10, an s-MFBIA device, in 128 BCRL patients. Inter-limb volume ratio was measured using TVM. The inter-limb ECW/TBW ratio was correlated with inter-limb volume ratio. Inter-limb ECW/TBW ratio and inter-limb volume ratio were then correlated with inter-limb PhA ratio to demonstrate the association between lymphedema severity and arm cellular integrity. The inter-limb ECW/TBW ratio and inter-limb volume ratio were positively correlated (r = 0.654, P < .001). The same result was obtained after adjusting for age, body mass index, postoperative survival, and duration of lymphedema (r = 0.636, 0.653, 0.652, and 0.648, P < .001). The inter-limb PhA ratio demonstrated significant negative correlation with inter-limb ECW/TBW ratio and inter-limb volume ratio (r = -0.896, -0.562, P < .001). s-MFBIA has high consistency with the conventional TVM method, and its relation to cellular integrity by segmental PhA enables better understanding of the cellular state of the affected limb in mild- to moderate-degree BCRL. Therefore, it is clinically feasible for severity assessment and monitoring of mild- to moderate-degree BCRL in smaller-built Asian patients.},

abstract = {Background: Bariatric surgery is proven to be the most effective therapy for obesity. However, the targeted weight reduction is not always achieved. Reliable predictors for postoperative success are rare. Also, most available predictors, such as gender and socioeconomic status, cannot be influenced. The aim of the study was to assess the reliability of the phase angle (PhA) as a predictor of weight reduction and body composition after bariatric surgery. Methods: One hundred seventy-three patients (127 with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 46 with sleeve gastrectomy), treated between January 2004 and December 2012, were included into this prospective trial. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was performed before and five times within the first year after the operation. Correlation between excess weight loss (EWL) was calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: The average weight loss was significant with a total weight loss of 30.1 %, while the PhA did not show any significant decrease during the first 12 months after surgery. The correlation between the preoperative PhA and the postoperative EWL was significant after 6 weeks and after 6, 9, and 12 months. The ROC curve has an area of 0.7. The best point of the curve is a PhA of 3.9° with a sensitivity of 81 % and a specificity of 54 %. Conclusions: PhA may be a useful predictor of EWL after bariatric surgery, and a PhA of 3.9° was calculated as the most suitable cut-off for a successful operation.},

abstract = {Introduction: Nutritional risk screening (NRS) is a widely accepted complex approach to evaluate nutritional (NT) status in gastroenterological (GI) patients (pts). Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a non-invasive, easy-to-use and reproducible technique to evaluate changes in body composition. Objectives: Evaluation of the association between NRS, BIA, phase angle (PhA) and surrogate parameters (SP), resp. for a NT assessment in GI pts. Methods: Nutritional status was assessed in 611 GI pts by NRS. In addition, BMI, serum albumin and serum transferrin were determined and BIA performed. Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) were estimated to determine the optimal cut-off levels of PhA. Results: By screening an increased risk of malnutrition (score NRS > 3) was found in 219 pts (35.8%). Well-nourished pts (score NRS 0 - 2) - 392 (64.2%) - had a statistically higher (p < 0.001) median phase angle (5.4 °± 1.03 °) as compared with the score NRS > 3 group (4.1 °± 1.08 °). Malnutrition was significantly associated with poorer results for BMI (p < 0.01), serum albumin (34.9 ± 7.4 vs. 40.5 ± 6.3; p < 0.001), serum transferrin (186.6 ± 67.7 vs. 253.5 ± 63.2; p < 0.001) and BIA (ECM/BCM-index 1.7 ± 0.8 vs. 1.12 ± 0.3; p < 0.001). A PhA of 4.85 ° in men was 74% sensitive and 71% specific and of 4.5 ° in women was 79% sensitive and 74% specific for detecting malnutrition [ROC (for men): 0.797 ± 0.027; 95% CI 0.745-.849, p < 0.001; ROC (for women): 0.808 ± 0.026; 95% CI 0.757-.860, p < 0.001)]. Conclusion: Malnutrition is highly prevalent in hospitalized GI-pts and is associated with distinct clinical diagnoses. The present study demonstrates that PhA is a good indicator of risk for malnutrition in GI-pts. There is a significant association between NT risk, low PhA and surrogate parameters, resp. The optimal cut-off level of PhA is helpful and practical to identify pts with malnutrition risk with the intent to limit the number of in-depth NT assessments and it can easily be included into clinical NT status evaluation and management.},

abstract = {Introduction: Increasing age and frailty of patients undergoing cardiac surgery complicate the selection of patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) phase angle is linked to long-term results after cardiac surgery and could be used as predictor. Methods: This observational retrospective study included all of the patients who underwent any of the STS defined elective cardiac surgery type from 2013 to 2014 at the Vilnius University Hospital. Patients who died in the hospital during the first post-operative month were excluded. BIA was performed prior surgery, demographic and comorbidity data were gathered in perioperative period. We evaluated 3-5 year all-cause mortality rate. Patients were categorized according to the BIA provided phase angle (PhA) value, which was standardized for age and gender; long-term predictors were determined by Cox regression analysis. Results: Among the cohort of 642 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the median age was 67.8 [59 - 73] years; most of them were men (67.8%). Long term mortality rate was 12.3% (n=79). Most of the cases were low risk with median EuroSCORE II value of 1.78 [1.07 - 2.49]. The rates of standardized PhA were as follows: <5th 10.4% (n=67), <10th 17.3% (n=111), <15th 22.7% (n=146), <20th 27.6% (n=177), <25th 35.5% (n=228), <30th 42.2 % (n=271), <35th 47.4 % (n=304), <40th 52% (n=334), <45th 58.6% (n=386). The Cox regression analysis of all percentiles revealed the most potent predictor - phase angle value below 25th of the reference range (OR 2.42, 95% CI: 1.49-3.94, p<0.001), with a mean difference in survival of 13.22 months (64.60 vs 51.38 p<0.001). This relation persisted after adjustment with EuroSCORE II value. Conclusions: BIA provided phase angle value can be used for longterm survival estimation before cardiac surgery. However, further studies are needed to prove the independent effect of these assumptions.},

abstract = {Background & aims: Bioelectrical impedance analysis-derived phase angle (PhA) has been gaining attention in the clinical evaluation of nutritional status because it is thought to be a proxy of water distribution and body cell mass; it is also associated to muscle strength and is an effective predictor of different clinical outcomes. Since an association may be expected between PhA and sarcopenia (defined by low skeletal muscle mass and impaired muscle function), the aim of this systematic review was to evaluate: a) changes in PhA due to sarcopenia; b) prevalence of sarcopenia according to PhA values; c) derivation of phase angle cut-offs for detecting sarcopenia; d) sarcopenia and PhA as predictors of clinical outcomes. Methods: A systematic research on electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science) from inception to January 31st, 2020 was performed according to PRISMA checklist. Using PICOS strategy, “P” corresponded to participants of any age, gender or ethnicity, “I” designated diagnosis of sarcopenia, “C” indicated subjects without sarcopenia, “O” corresponded to PhA, and “S” selected all study types. Methodological quality was assessed using the National Institute of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool. Results: Through the initial literature search and after removing duplicates and excluding papers by screening titles and abstracts, 79 potentially relevant studies were examined. Thirteen studies (7668 subjects) met the inclusion criteria. The overall risk of bias was low. Sarcopenia was associated with a significant lower PhA in seven studies out of eight, while five studies out of six reported a high prevalence of sarcopenia was in patients with low PhA. Different cut-off point values from 4.05 to 5.05° have been derived for the identification of sarcopenia. PhA and sarcopenia were independent predictors of survival in cancer patients and geriatric hospitalized patients. Conclusions: Data from the selected papers demonstrate that PhA is decreased in sarcopenic subjects and the prevalence of sarcopenia is higher in subjects with low PhA. Further studies are needed to determine to what extent PhA may be valuable in detecting low muscle quality and/or identifying sarcopenia.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The phase angle has been suggested to be an indicator of cellular health and reported to be related to predictive factors and therapeutic effects in various diseases. The part related to osteoporosis is also being revealed. However, the relationship between phase angle and osteoporosis in hemodialysis patients is unknown. METHODS: Total 141 hemodialysis patients, 75 men and 66 women, aged 40 years or older were included in the study. All patients underwent measurement of femoral neck bone mineral density by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The phase angle measured with BIA is one of the clinically important impedance parameters. Osteoporosis was diagnosed according to theWHOclassification, and statistical comparisons were conducted according to the presence or absence of osteoporosis. RESULTS: Of the patients included, 56 were diagnosed with osteoporosis (39.7%). There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of gender, age, renal transplantation history, history of fracture, body mass index, and skeletal muscle index when comparing baseline values according to presence or absence of osteoporosis. The phase angles reported in this study also showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups (4.8° ±1.0 versus 4.4° ±1.1, p=0.048). In patients with hemodialysis who have low phase angle values, the possibility of osteoporosis is high. High phase angle values in patients without osteoporosis reflect high cellularity and cell membrane integrity, and better cell function. However, considering the phase angle value in normal healthy individuals from 5° to 7°, we could confirm that the phase angle is low regardless of the presence or absence of osteoporosis in hemodialysis patients. CONCLUSIONS: The phase angle is a predictor of osteoporosis, and a lower phase angle is associated with greater probability of osteoporosis in hemodialysis patients. In hemodialysis patients, osteoporosis-related diseases can be prevented by diagnosing and treating osteoporosis more quickly using phase angle.},

abstract = {Chronic kidney disease is a condition that promotes oxidative stress. There are conflicting evidence about the role of hemodialysis on oxidative stress, that are mostly related with the various types of membrane materials used, the quality and type of dialysate, the method used, etc. The phase angle (PhA), which is determined with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), measures the functionality of cell membranes. In this study, the correlation of the PhA with parameters of oxidative stress is attempted for the first time. We evaluated parameters of oxidative status as total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in erythrocytes (RBCs) and plasma of patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis with low flux synthetic polysulfone membranes. Measurements were recorded from 30 patients (16 men and 14 women) aged 64 ± 14 years before, during, and after dialysis, and in 15 healthy volunteers aged 56 ± 12 years The PhA was obtained by BIA. The plasma TAC increased significantly (41%, p < 0.05). Intracellular TAC noted a non-significant increase. Total antioxidant capacity of the patients before and after hemodialysis was significantly lower from the healthy volunteers (p < 0.05) showing that ESRD patients are at the state of increased oxidative stress. The PhA increased in significantly positive correlation with plasma TAC at the end of hemodialysis. The process of hemodialysis with biocompatible synthetic membranes and bicarbonate dialysate improved plasma TAC. The positive correlation of PhA with extracellular TAC could evolve to a method of oxidative stress estimation by BIA but further research is needed.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Protein-energy wasting is common in hemodialysis patients and is an independent risk factor for adverse events. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is now widely used as a non-invasive method to estimate nutritional status. We retrospectively investigated whether a nutritional marker measured by BIA can predict clinical outcomes in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving hemodialysis. METHODS: ESRD patients who had been treated with outpatient hemodialysis were recruited. Using BIA, phase angle (PA) was obtained every 6 months, and patients were divided into two groups according to baseline PA: group A included patients with PA ≥4.5°, while group B included patients with PA <4.5°. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients (77 [54.2%] in group A and 65 [45.8%] in group B) were included and were followed-up for 29 (12, 42) months. Baseline PA was 4.6 ± 1.0°.We found that a decrease in PA was associated with an increased risk of death that persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 - 0.97; P = 0.039). Cardiovascular events were not associated with PA (P = 0.685). Conversely, we found that PA predicted the occurrence of infection, independent of age, sex, and comorbidities (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 - 0.94; P = 0.021). Although levels of hemoglobin did not differ between groups during the study period, patients in group B received higher doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and intravenous iron than those in group A (P = 0.004 and 0.044, respectively). In longitudinal analyses, we did not find increases in PA over time in patients who had a mean Kt/Vurea ≥1.4, protein catabolic rate ≥1.2 g/kg/day, or total carbon dioxide level ≥22 $\mu$mol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional status can be assessed in a simple manner using BIA, and it provides practical information to predict clinical outcomes such as infection and all-cause death in ESRD patients on maintenance hemodialysis.},

abstract = {Summary: Although the phase angle has been reported to be related to predictive factors and therapeutic effects in various diseases, its relation with osteoporosis is unclear. In our large prospective survey of community-dwelling people, a low phase angle was related with osteoporosis, and it could be a predictor of osteoporosis. Purpose: The phase angle measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is one of the clinically important impedance parameters, and it is a predictor of prognosis and mortality for several diseases. The present cross-sectional study aimed to elucidate the association between osteoporosis and variables measured with BIA, including the phase angle. Methods: The study included 307 participants from an annual health checkup. All participants underwent measurement of bone status by quantitative ultrasound and body composition by BIA. Osteoporosis was diagnosed according to the WHO classification, and statistical comparisons were conducted between normal individuals and osteoporosis patients. Results: Age, proteins, minerals, and the phase angle were significantly different between normal individuals and osteoporosis patients (p < 0.001). Furthermore, after controlling for age and sex, proteins, minerals, and the phase angle were significantly lower in osteoporosis patients than those in normal individuals (p < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, older age and a low phase angle were risk factors for osteoporosis. Additionally, multiple regression analysis showed that age, sex, proteins, minerals, and the appendicular skeletal muscle index were significantly related to the phase angle. Conclusions: The phase angle is a predictor of osteoporosis, which is unaffected by age and sex, and a lower phase angle is associated with greater probability of osteoporosis. The phase angle can be easily measured, and osteoporosis can be confirmed even at home. This may facilitate early diagnosis and treatment, which may be useful for preventing diseases related to osteoporosis.},

abstract = {Purpose: A high phase angle measured by the Nutriguard{\textregistered} bioelectrical impedance analysis device is associated with a reduced mortality risk in older people. This retrospective study aims to analyze whether this association persists with the other devices that have been used in our hospital. Methods: This study encompasses all people 65 yrs and older who underwent a phase angle measurement between 1990 and 2011 at the Geneva University Hospitals, with the RJL-101{\textregistered} (RJL Systems), Xitron 4000B{\textregistered} (Xitron Technologies), Eugedia{\textregistered} (Eug{\'{e}}dia-Spengler) and Bio-Z{\textregistered} (Spengler). Diseases at the time of phase angle measurement were reported in the form of the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. Date of death was retrieved until December 2012. Phase angle values were categorized into sex- and device-specific quartiles, where quartile 1 represents the lowest quartile and reference value. Cox regressions were performed to evaluate the association between phase angle quartiles and mortality. Results: We considered 1878 people (969 women), of whom 1151 had died. In univariate sex-specific Cox regressions, the death risk decreased progressively as the phase angle quartile measured by the Bio-Z{\textregistered} or RJL-101{\textregistered} increased. The HR (95% CI) in quartile 4 was 0.36 (0.26, 0.50) and 0.38 (0.29, 052) in women and men measured with the Bio-Z{\textregistered} (both p < 0.001), and 0.23 (0.14, 0.39) and 0.19 (0.10, 0.36) in women and men measured with the RJL-101{\textregistered} (both p < 0.001). The association between phase angle and mortality persisted when adjusted for age, body mass index or co-morbidities. The small number of deaths in people who underwent a measurement by Eugedia{\textregistered} (n = 93) or Xitron 4000B{\textregistered} (n = 56) did not allow performing multivariate Cox regressions. Conclusions: Phase angle quartiles are associated with mortality in people aged ≥65 years when using the RJL-101{\textregistered} or Bio-Z device{\textregistered}.},

abstract = {Background and Aims: Sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DPN) is the most common diabetic complication and a major contributor to increased morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. With diagnostic methods still being limited, we aimed to correlate the phase angle (PhA) , a marker derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis, with determinants of DPN. In particular we used magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) together with state-of-the-art clinical and electrophysiological measurements of DPN. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study we included 1healthy subjects and 2patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) , amongst which 63 had DPN. The PhA was calculated using a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer. Nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing (QST) and diffusion weighted 3 Tesla MRN to determine the fractional anisotropy (FA) were performed. Results: In the group comparison lower PhA values were found in T2D patients with DPN in contrast to T2D patients without DPN (5.71+/-0.vs. 6.07+/-0.08, p=0.007) and healthy controls (5.71+/-0.vs. 6.18+/-0.08, p<0.001) . Confounder-adjusted analysis among T2D patients showed positive correlations of the PhA with the FA of MRN (r=0.41, p=0.006) , with conduction velocities and action potentials of the peroneal (r=0.27, p<0.001; r=0.29, p<0.001) and tibial nerve (r=0.22, p=0.005; r=0.30, p<0.001) and with Z-scores of QST (thermal detection r=0.31, p<0.001; thermal pain r=0.20, p=0.010; mechanical pain r=0.19, p=0.015; mechanical detection r=0.19, p=0.013) . Conclusion: The close association of the PhA with the FA, a marker of structural nerve integrity of MRN, might reflect the similar physics of current or diffusion respectively being impaired by altered nerve composition. Due to correlations of the PhA with classical diagnostics of DPN it could become a novel, easily accessible and powerful marker for a quick assessment of DPN.},

This study aimed to determine the diagnostic test accuracy of bioelectrical impedance analysis derived-phase angle (PhA) in detecting PEW among HD patients. This was a multi-centre, cross-sectional study conducted amongst 152 multiethnic HD patients in Klang Valley, Malaysia. PEW was assessed using the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism criteria as the reference method. PhA was measured using a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy at 50 kHz. Multiple and logistic regressions were used to determine factors associated with PhA and PEW diagnosis, respectively. A receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was used to establish the gender-specific PhA cut-offs to detect PEW. PEW existed in 21.1% of the HD patients. PhA was found as an independent predictor of PEW (adjOR = 0.308, p = 0.001), with acceptable to excellent discriminative performance (adjAUCmale = 0.809; adjAUCfemale = 0.719). Male patients had higher PhA cut-off compared to female patients (4.26 vs. 3.30). We concluded that PhA is a valid and pragmatic biomarker to detect PEW in multi-ethnic Malaysian HD patients and a gender-specific cut-off is necessary, attributed to the gender differences in body composition.},

abstract = {Objectives: Musculoskeletal fitness and body composition are major components of health-related physical fitness that are expected to be linked to each other. The aim of this study was to explore the association of musculoskeletal fitness (expressed as hand grip strength [HGS]) and raw bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) variables and other predictors in the second and third decades of life. Methods: Four groups of healthy normal-weight and overweight participants were studied: 130 male adolescents (age 16.0 ± 1.1 y), 143 female adolescents (16.0 ± 0.9 y), 141 young men (25.5 ± 2.0 y), and 141 young women (25.2 ± 1.9 y). Raw BIA variables (impedance [Z] and phase angle [PhA]) for the whole body were measured at four frequencies (5, 50, 100, and 250 kHz), and HGS was measured in both upper limbs. Results: HGS was higher in males than females and higher in young men than male adolescents. A fairly strong correlation emerged in both genders between HGS and raw BIA variables—that is, bioimpedance index (height2/Z), PhA, and impedance ratios (Z at high frequency/Z at low frequency). In multiple regression analysis, bioimpedance index, PhA, and impedance ratio were more effective predictors of HGS than BIA-derived estimates of body composition or anthropometric variables such as height, weight, and body mass index. In both genders, HGS was significantly higher in young adults than in adolescents for the same PhA or impedance ratio. Conclusions: This study provides some insight into the use of raw BIA variables and HGS in the first decades of life, suggesting a new approach for a reliable assessment of muscle quality in terms of both muscle structure and strength.},

abstract = {Rationale: Even though bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) derived phase angle (PA) is used to define nutritional state of the patients, there are no definite PA cut-off value of malnutrition. Therefore aim of this study is to determine the malnutrition specific cut-off value of the BIA derived PA. Methods: We conducted an observational study in a tertiary reference hospital. Nutritional state of 99 ESRD patients was examined post HD procedure using Subjective Global Assessment scale (SGA) and BIA derived PA. Values of PA were standardized and stratified by age and gender using population reference values. Patients were split into groups with PA values below 5th through 50th percentile of the mean reference value. The relationship between these groups and SGA defined malnutrition were evaluated using ROC AUC and the most accurate percentile was detected. Results: Mean age of the patients was 58.7 ± 14.4 years, half of them were men 51 (51.4%) with mean time on HD for 6.1 ± 5.6 years. The SGA rates of nutrition were as follows: well-nourished 56 (56.6%), malnourished 28 (28.3%) and severely malnourished 14 (12.2%). Mean PA was 4.87 ± 1.08 SD, and rates of patients in different percentile groups were as follows: <5th = 39 (39.4%), <10th = 53 (53.5%), <15th = 59 (59.6%), <20th = 62 (62.6%), <25th = 70 (70.7%), <30th = 74 (74.7%), <35th = 75 (75.8%), <40th = 79 (79.8%), <45th = 83 (83.8%), <50th = 87 (87.9%). The cut-off of 10th percentile was revealed as the most accurate with ROC AUC of 0.73 CI95% 0.61-0.85 p < 0.001 for SGA severe malnutrition and ROC AUC of 0.68 CI95% 0.59-0.8 p = 0.001 for SGA moderate and severe malnutrition. Conclusion: Malnutrition is present in almost half of the HD patients. BIA provided and standardized PA is an accurate and potent marker of malnutrition. The malnutrition cut-off percentile we report in our study must be further evaluated in upcoming studies before implementation into clinical practice.},

abstract = {Rationale: Nutritional status can been evaluated by various objective measures, including anthropometric and laboratory parameters. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is an easy-to-use, non-invasive and reproducible method for evaluating changes in body composition that reflect changes in nutritional status. BIA-derived phase angle (PhA) is considered a biological marker of cellular health and has been proven to be a predictor of morbidity and mortality in a variety of patient populations including cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between BIA-derived phase angle (PhA) and overall 30 day post operative complications in patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in a single center in Athens, Greece. A series of 89 patients (aged 40-81 year, 40.2% women) with pancreatic cancer undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy between November 2016 and February 2020 were included in the study. Data including patients' characteristics, laboratory results, and 30 day post operative complications were recorded during the perioperative period. BIA was performed using a multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyser (InBody S10; Korea), with patients lying supine on a bed or examination table, with legs apart and arms not touching the torso. Potential associations between PhA values and postoperative complications were analyzed using generalized linear models adjusted for age, BMI, serum albumin levels, gender and total bilirubin. Results: Median PhA values were 5.9 (4.2 – 7.9), and their distribution had no association with demographic and clinical factors such as sex, disease stage; however, it was significantly associated with age. A total of 32 patients (35,9%) suffered from postoperative complications (19 cases of pancreatic fistulas grade A & B and 13 cases of delayed gastric emptying). There were significant differences in the postoperative complications incidence between younger and older individuals (>65 years) (p=0.016), those with short and longer hospital stays (>12 days) (p=0.007), and between individuals who survived and those who did not (p=0.002). After adjustments for age, sex, BMI, serum albumin levels and total caloric intake, it was found that individuals in the lowest tertile of PhA had a doubled risk of post operative complications compared with individuals in the upper tertile of PhA (RR=2.01; 95% CI 1.21-2.82, p=0.004). Conclusion: PhA values among patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy may serve as a significant predictor of 30 day postoperative complications incidence.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Phase angle (PA) determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis has been suggested to be a predictor of death in a variety of disease conditions, but its associations with outcomes have not yet been assessed in a large continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patient cohort. The aim of the present study was to examine the association of PA with risks for all-cause and cardiovascular death in patients treated with CAPD. METHODS: Incident CAPD patients were enrolled from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015 and were followed until December 31, 2017. Multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis was conducted in the morning with patients in a fasting state. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to study the relationships between PA and other variables. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the association between PA and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 760 incident CAPD patients were enrolled in this study. Patients have a median PA value of 4.59° ranging from 2.30° to 7.22°. Aging, presence of diabetes mellitus, and fluid overload were independently associated with lower PA, whereas male sex, higher body mass index, higher serum levels of albumin and creatinine, and better residual renal function were independently associated with higher PA in a multivariable linear regression model. A total of 125 (16.4%) patients died during a median follow-up of 42 months. In the Cox model with adjustment for confounders, PA was significantly associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in incident CAPD patients (hazard ratio, 0.584; 95% confidence interval, 0.403 to 0.844, P = .004; hazard ratio, 0.597; 95% confidence interval, 0.359 to 0.993, P = .047, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PA reflected a combined dimension of the illness including deranged hydration status and nutritional status. Lower PA was associated with both all-cause and cardiovascular death in patients with CAPD.},

This study aimed to examine the relationship between PhA and exercise habits or objectively measured physical activity. We included 115 people aged 32-69 years. The body composition and PhA were measured using a bioelectrical impedance device. Physical activity and sedentary behavior (SB) were assessed using a triaxial accelerometer. Exercise habits were also obtained through structured interviews, and participants were categorized into the no exercise habit (No-Ex), resistance training exercise habit (RT), or aerobic training exercise habit (AT) groups. Objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity or step count significantly correlated with PhA, independent of age, sex, height, percent body fat, body cell mass, and leg muscle power. In contrast, SB was not significant determinants of PhA. People who exercised regularly (RT or AT) had significantly higher PhA values than did those in the No-Ex group. Furthermore, the PhA was not significantly different between the RT and AT groups. Regularly engaging in exercise with moderate-to-vigorous intensity may improve or maintain muscle cellular health and muscle quality.},

abstract = {Introduction Bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) is a non-invasive bedside method used to estimate body composition. However, validity of estimates are dependent on multiple assumptions that are frequently violated in sick and hospitalised patients. Raw impedance parameters, such as phase angle (PA) are less affected by hydration status and fluid shifts. Hypothesis PA may be a better indicator of body composition than conventional BIA-derived fat free mass (FFM) in patients hospitalised with AECOPD. Method PA, FFM (Bodystat 4000), 4-metre gait speed(4MGS), five-repetition sit-to-stand(5STS), quadriceps maximum voluntary contraction(QMVC) and handgrip strength(HG) were measured at discharge in 209 patients hospitalised for AECOPD. Pearson's correlations were used to assess the relationship between PA and FFM with muscle strength and physical performance. Results Cohort characteristics were:53%male; mean(SD) age 72(11);BMI 26.5(6.9);FEV1%pred 40(20); MRC dyspnoea score 4(1); median(IQR) length of stay 3(1,5). Correlations between PA and FFM with muscle strength and physical performance are shown in Table 1. FFM did not correlate significantly with 4MGS,5STS,QMVC or HG. Conclusion Conventional BIA-derived FFM does not correlate with parameters of muscle strength and physical performance in hospitalised patients with COPD. Raw impedance parameters such as phase angle are better indicators of muscle health in hospitalised patients with COPD. (Table Presented).},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between phase angle (PhA) and first cardiovascular (CV) event risk. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. PhA was determined using a single-frequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer. Scores from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA; N = 455; 49% men) and the Framingham General Cardiovascular (FRS-CVD; N = 489; 49% men) were used to estimate the risk for a first CV event in adults. Logistic and multinomial regressions were used to evaluate the relationship between ACC/AHA and FRS-CVD risk scores (outcomes) and PhA. Additionally, the consumption of in natura or minimally processed foods was included in the models as an adjustment variable. Results: Men and women, classified according to ACC/AHA (P < 0.001; P = 0.035) and FRS-CVD scores (P = 0.002; P = 0.012) as low risk for first event CV, presented higher PhA values than participants with elevated risk. However, only in men categorized as CV high risk, the third PhA tertile (>7.3°) was associated with a CV lower risk (ACC/AHA, odds ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14–0.56; FRS-CVD, relative risk ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03–0.37). The adjustment of all models for consumption of in natura or minimally processed foods did not change the results. Conclusion: Higher PhA values were associated with lower risk for a first CV event in men classified in higher-risk categories. In natura or minimally processed food consumption did not influence the relationship between PhA and CV risk. These results may encourage future research about possible applications of PhA as an additional index in primary prevention of CV events.},

abstract = {Background: Methods that facilitate muscle quality measurement may improve the diagnosis of sarcopenia. Current research has focused on the phase angle (PhA) obtained through bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as an indicator of cellular health, particularly cell membrane integrity and cell function. The current study therefore aimed to evaluate the relationship between the PhA and muscle quality and muscle-related parameters and to determine factors associated with the PhA. Moreover, we attempted to determine the cut-off value of PhA for predicting sarcopenia. Methods: First-year university students (830 male students, 18.5 ± 0.6 years old; 422 female students, 18.3 ± 0.5 years old) and community-dwelling elderly individuals (70 male individuals, 74.4 ± 5.5 years old; 97 female individuals, 73.1 ± 6.4 years old) were included. PhA and other body composition data were measured using BIA, while muscle quality was calculated by dividing handgrip strength by upper limbs muscle mass. The relationship between PhA and the aforementioned parameters were then analysed, after which the cut-off value of PhA for predicting sarcopenia was examined. Results: Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), and muscle quality were independently associated with PhA in both sexes [male (age: standardized regression coefficient ($\beta$) = −0.43, P < 0.001, SMI: $\beta$ = 0.61, P < 0.001, muscle quality: $\beta$ = 0.13, P < 0.001) and female (age: $\beta$ = −0.56, P < 0.001, SMI: $\beta$ = 0.52, P < 0.001, muscle quality: $\beta$ = 0.09, P = 0.007)]. Participants with sarcopenia had a significantly lower PhA compared with those without it (sarcopenia vs. non-sarcopenia: young male participants, 5.51 ± 0.41° vs. 6.25 ± 0.50°, P < 0.001; young female participants, 4.88 ± 0.16° vs. 5.37 ± 0.44°, P = 0.005; elderly female participants: 4.14 ± 0.29° vs. 4.63 ± 0.42°, P = 0.009). Although no significant findings were observed in elderly male participants, the same tendency was noted. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that PhA had good predictive ability for sarcopenia in young male, elderly male, young female, and elderly female participants (area under the ROC curve of 0.882, 0.838, 0.865, and 0.850, with cut-off PhA values of 5.95°, 5.04°, 5.02°, and 4.20° for predicting sarcopenia, respectively). Conclusions: The PhA reflected muscle quality and exhibited good accuracy in detecting sarcopenia, suggesting its utility as an index for easily measuring muscle quality, which could improve the diagnosis of sarcopenia.},

abstract = {Background: Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) has been widely used in the evaluation of body composition in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). We conducted this study to evaluate impact of PA and sarcopenia measured by BIA on clinical prognosis in these patients. Methods: This longitudinal retrospective study enrolled patients who underwent hemodialysis between January 2016 and March 2019. The patients were stratified into higher (> 4°) and lower (≤ 4.0°) PA groups. Sarcopenia was defined when the appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was < 20 kg in men and < 15 kg in women. Results: Of the 191 patients, 63.4% were men. The mean age was 64.2 ± 12.4 years. The lower PA group was older, had a higher proportion of women, a lower BMI, lower albumin, cholesterol, uric acid, and phosphorus levels, and a higher incidence of history of coronary artery disease (CAD) than the higher PA group. Linear regression analysis revealed that PA was significantly associated with BMI (B=0.18, p=0.005), serum albumin (B=0.23, p=0.001), and creatinine levels (B=0.32, p<0.001). During a median follow-up of 16.7 months, 14.1% (n = 27) of patients experienced MACE and 11.0% (n = 21) died. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the higher PA group had significantly better survival, regardless of sarcopenia. Multivariate Cox analyses revealed that lower PA (0.51 [0.31-0.85], p=0.010), higher IDWG (1.06 [1.01-1.12], p=0.028) and C-reactive protein level (1.01 [1.01-1.02], p<0.001), and a history of CAD (3.02 [1.04-8.77], p=0.042) were significantly related to all-cause mortality after adjusting for other covariates. Conclusions: PA measured by BIA was an independent factor in the prediction of mortality in MHD patients, regardless of sarcopenia. Intervention studies are needed to confirm if the improvement in PA is associated with better clinical outcome.},

abstract = {Background: Bio-impedance is the measure of impedance of the body. Impedance consists of resistance and reactance. Phase angle (PA) is the tan value of the ratio of reactance versus resistance. PA depends on cell membrane integrity and on body cell mass. Earlier studies have shown a correlation between PA values and body cell mass. Body cell mass varies in chronic diseases like HIV infection, tuberculosis, cancers and chronic renal failure.
Aims: The aim of this study was to compare the PA values of tuberculosis patients (TB) with that of control subjects and to compare the anthropometric values between the groups.
Results: The PA values were 5.09±1.11° and 7.2±1.27° in TB patients and control subjects respectively. PA values were positively correlated with Body mass index (BMI) in TB patients and control (r=0.42 and 0.011, both p<0.001). Mean difference and its 95% confidence interval between groups for PA were −2.11 (−2.72, −1.49), for weight −13.9 (−18.1, −9.7), for BMI −5.65 (−7.1, −4.2), for corrected arm muscle area (CAMA) −9.91 (−13.2, −6.6) and for impedance 152.6 (106.6, 198.6). PA, weight, BMI and CAMA were significantly higher in control subjects and impedance was lower in control groups using independent sample t test.
Conclusions: PA and nutritional status were significantly low in TB patients as compared with control subjects.
Material and Methods: Bioimpedance analysis and PA measurements were done using Bodystat Quadscan 4000 machine on 30 tuberculosis patients and controls between the age group of 18 to 50 years.},

abstract = {Objective. There is a limited diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, the noninvasive assessments are worth exploring. We determined the associations of phase angles (PhAs) obtained from bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) with the risk of NAFLD in an overweight population. Methods. A study involving 953 overweight participants was conducted in Wuhan city, China. The associations between PhAs (right arm, left arm, body trunk, right leg, left leg, and whole body) and the risk of NAFLD were conducted using multivariate logistic regression analyses. The associations of PhAs with the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), a noninvasive assessment of liver steatosis and fibrosis, were also evaluated by both linear and logistic regression analyses. Results. The PhA values of the whole body, trunk, and legs were significantly lower (P<0.05) in the NAFLD group than the non-NAFLD group. After adjustment for BMI, gender, education, income/year, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, passive smoking, and drinking, significant associations of PhA values of the right leg, left leg, and whole body with the risk of NAFLD were observed. In addition, the PhA of the right leg, left leg, and whole body were significantly related to the CAP values. Further stratified analyses indicated that these associations were significant in the participants with BMI <30, but not in the participants with BMI ≥30. Conclusions. PhAs might be effective indicators in the management of NAFLD among overweight people.},

Patients and Methods: This case-control study enrolled 78 femoral neck fracture patients aged over 75 years (29 males) and 1:2 matched healthy controls. All participants were subjected to BIA examination by specialists. tSM, the corrected values by height squared of tSM (tSMI) and phase angle were compared between fracture patients and controls. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to explore the strength of association of femoral neck fracture with tSM, tSMI, and phase angle. Results: tSM (kg) of fracture patients was significantly lower than those of controls in all participants (women: 13.49±0.42 vs 15.44±0.39, p<0.05; men: 15.30±0.71 vs 17.54±0.78, p<0.05). In the sarcopenic subgroup, fracture patients also got a lower tSM than controls (women: 12.58±0.21 vs 13.62±0.16, p<0.05; men:14.41±0.29 vs 16.07±0.21, p<0.05). The comparison of tSMI between the two groups was similar to that of tSM. Phase angle (°) at 50 kHz in fracture patients was significantly lower than that of controls in women and men (women: 3.70±0.32 vs 4.61±0.21, p<0.05; men: 3.50±0.20 vs 3.84±0.22, p<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated higher fracture chance with significantly associated decreased tSM [women: OR (95% CI): 0.78(0.67–0.91); men: 0.74(0.64–-0.86)] and tSMI [women: OR (95% CI): 0.72(0.61–0.85); men: 0.69 (0.59–0.81)]. In addition, per 1° increase of phase angle in the trunk could decrease the fracture risk by 14% for women [OR (95% CI): 0.86 0.79–0.94)] and 29% for men [OR (95% CI): 0.71 (0.64–0.79)]. Conclusion: This study indicates a decrease in tSM, tSMI, and phase angle measured by BIA is significantly related to the increased chance of femoral neck fracture in people aged over 75 years. Strengthening the mass and strength of trunk skeletal muscles may help reduce the risk of femoral neck fracture in elderly patients.},

abstract = {Objective: Because cirrhotic patients are at high risk of malnutrition and sarcopenia, we evaluated the prevalence of low fat-free mass index (FFMI) and low phase angle (PhA) among patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Methods: In total, 135 subjects with CHC (50.4% males; mean age, 52.4 ± 11.8 years; 65.9% noncirrhotic and 34.1% compensated cirrhotic patients) were prospectively included and evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Subjective global assessment was used to evaluate malnutrition. Results: Low FFMI and low PhA were identified in 21.5% and 23.7% of the patients, respectively. Compensated cirrhotic patients had lower PhA values than those without cirrhosis. Low FFMI was associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR], 2.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00–7.01; P =.04) and malnutrition (OR, 4.27; 95% CI, 1.42–12.90; P =.01). Low PhA was associated with cirrhosis (OR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.56–9.86; P =.004), malnutrition (OR, 5.52; 95% CI, 1.73–17.62; P =.004), and current alcohol use (OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.01–7.58; P =.05). Reactance (Xc) normalized for height (H), an indicator of muscle strength, was independently associated with male sex, age, hypertension, and serum albumin. Conclusion: Host factors, including clinical comorbidities, lifestyle, and nutrition status, are associated with low FFMI and low PhA in noncirrhotic and in compensated cirrhotic patients with CHC. These findings highlight the relevance of evaluating body composition in patients chronically infected by hepatitis C virus independently of the stage of liver disease.},

abstract = {Question To investigate whether phase angle (PA), an indicator of cell membrane integrity measured via whole-body bioimpendance, may be useful for cardiovascular risk assessment. Methods 452 adults were examined (age 58.0±13.3 years, 47.3% females, glucose tolerant n=113, prediabetes n=40, type 1 diabetes n=67, type 2 diabetes n=232). The association of PA with indices of subclinical atherosclerosis (IntimaMedia thickness-IMT, carotid-femoral Pulse Wave Velocity-cfPWV, Ankle-Brachial Index-ABI) and cardiac biomarkers (highsensitive Troponin-hsTnT, brain natriuretic peptide-BNP) was investigated. Multivariable regression analysis between each parameter and PA was conducted, including glucose tolerance, diabetes duration, age, gender, Body Mass Index, waist circumference, and established cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, smoking, LDL-/non-HDL-cholesterol, eGFR, HbA1c) as covariates. Results Across the four glycemic groups there were significant differences regarding PA (6.20±0.79 vs. 6.17±0.73 vs. 6.11±0.81 vs. 5.89±0.91 degrees, respectively, p=0.006) and all tested cardiovascular factors excluding BNP (p<0.001). In multivariable regression analysis, PA independently correlated with all parameters except for IMT (cfPWV: $\beta$=-0.156, p=0.001; ABI: $\beta$=0.116, p=0.052; hsTnT: $\beta$=-0.307, p<0.001; BNP: $\beta$=-0.277, p<0.001). In binary logistic regression analysis there were corresponding differences regarding PA between upper and lower quartiles of tested factors (adjusted ORs between 1st -4th quartiles: cfPWV: 0.35 [0.14-0.86], p=0.023; ABI: 1.54 [1.02-2.33], p=0.038; hsTnT: 0.17 [0.07- 0.47], p=0.001; BNP: 0.35 [0.18-0.68], p=0.002). Further adjustments for antidiabetic medication and statin use as well as subgroup analysis within the type 2 diabetes group yielded similar results. Conclusion Lower PA values are independently associated with several established cardiovascular markers, rendering it a potential candidate for cardiovascular risk assessment.},

Phase angle (PA) is the tan value of the ratio of reactance versus electric resistance. PA depends on cell membrane integrity and on body cell mass. There exists a correlation between PA values and body cell mass. The objective of this study was to compare the PA values of normal individuals and their anthropometric measurements. Materials and Methods Anthropometric measurements, Bioelectrical impedance analysis and PA measurements were done using Bodystat Quadscan 4000 machine on 42 healthy subjects between the age group of 18 to 50 yrs at a private hospital, Bangalore, Karnataka, India for eight months. Kolmogrov-Smirnov and Pearson's correlation tests were used for data analysis. Results The PA values were 7.32±1.17° in healthy subjects. PA values were significantly positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r= 0.011, P<0.001). The phase angle values for males and females were 7.43±0.98° and 7.05±1.1.58°, respectively.

abstract = {Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and especially its derived parameter phase angle have been widely used in different populations. The variability of BIA measures has often been cited as a major limitation for its clinical use in evaluating nutritional status and overall health of patients. Cancer patients often present with malnourishment and cachexia, which complicate the course of treatment and affect outcomes. PubMed, CINAHL, EBSCO and Cochrane Library have been searched for relevant publications in English for BIA in cancer patients. Out of 197 total results, 27 original research articles related to BIA measures in cancer patients were included in this review. Studies indicate that the use of BIA and phase angle measures can benefit in the clinical management of cancer patients in multiple ways: in the prevention; diagnosis; prognosis; and outcomes related to treatments that affect nutritional and overall health status. Phase angle and fat-free mass measures were most commonly evaluated and correlated with nutritional status and survival rate. One limitation of BIA measures is the high interpatient variability which requires careful interpretation of results in the context of the individual patient rather than comparison with population data. The BIA and phase angle provide practitioners for the evaluation of nutritional and overall health status in cancer patients with a convenient and non-invasive technique and should be encouraged.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An accurate estimation of athletes' energy needs is crucial in diet planning to improve sport performance and to maintain an appropriate body composition. This study aimed to develop and validate in elite athletes new equations for estimating resting energy expenditure (REE) based on anthropometric parameters as well as bioimpedance analysis (BIA)-derived raw variables and to validate the accuracy of selected predictive equations. METHODS: Adult elite athletes aged 18-40 yrs were studied. Anthropometry, indirect calorimetry and BIA were performed in all subjects. The new predictive equations were generated using different regression models. The accuracy of the new equations was assessed at the group level (bias) and at the individual level (precision accuracy), and then compared with the one of five equations used in the general population or three athletes-specific formulas. RESULTS: One-hundred and twenty-six male athletes (age 26.9 ± 9.1 yrs; weight 71.3 ± 10.9 kg; BMI 22.8 ± 2.7 kg/m2) from different sport specialties were randomly assigned to the calibration (n = 75) or validation group (n = 51). REE was directly correlated with individual characteristics, except for age, and raw BIA variables. Most of the equations from the literature were reasonably accurate at the population level (bias within ±5%). The new equations showed a mean bias -0.3% (Eq. A based on anthropometric parameters) and -0.6% (Eq. B based on BIA-derived raw variables). Precision accuracy (individual predicted-measured differences within ±5%) was $\sim$75% in six out of eight of the selected equations and even higher for Eq. A (82.4%) and Eq. B (92.2%). CONCLUSION: In elite athletes, BIA-derived phase angle is a significant predictor of REE. The new equations have a very good prediction accuracy at both group and individual levels. The use of phase angle as predictor of REE requires further research with respect to different sport specialties, training programs and training level.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a quick, noninvasive method of evaluating body compartments. Phase angle (PA), as a reflection of body cell mass, is objectively determined from resistance and reactance measured by BIA. OBJECTIVES. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical application of PA for the nutritional assessment of critically ill patients. METHODS. We analyzed 89 adult patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary academic hospital from August 2012 to September 2013. PA values were measured by direct segmental multi-frequency BIA. As traditional nutrition assessment tools, body mass index (BMI), serum albumin levels, total lymphocyte counts, and our hospital's nutrition screening index (NSI) were also recorded. The correlations between the results of BIA and other traditional parameters were analyzed. RESULTS. PA was correlated with traditional nutritional parameters, including BMI (r = 0.479), serum albumin (r = 0.347), and NSI score (r = 0.483). Patients with PA lower than the median value (3.5°) had significantly lower nutritional status, and suffered from increased duration of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.039) and length of ICU stay (P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS. PA measured by BIA could be a potentially useful parameter for nutritional assessment in critically ill patients.},

abstract = {Background/Objectives: A low bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived phase angle (PA) predicts morbidity and mortality in different patient groups. An association between PA and long-term mortality in ICU patients has not been demonstrated before. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether PA on ICU admission independently predicts 90-day mortality. Subjects/ methods: This prospective observational study was performed in a mixed university ICU. BIA was performed in 196 patients within 24 h of ICU admission. To test the independent association between PA and 90-day mortality, logistic regression analysis was performed using the APACHE IV predicted mortality as confounder. The optimal cutoff value of PA for mortality prediction was determined by ROC curve analysis. Using this cutoff value, patients were categorized into low or normal PA group and the association with 90-day mortality was tested again. Results: The PA of survivors was higher than of the non-survivors (5.0° ± 1.3° vs. 4.1° ± 1.2°, p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve of PA for 90-day mortality was 0.70 (CI 0.59-0.80). PA was associated with 90-day mortality (OR = 0.56, CI: 0.38-0.77, p = 0.001) on univariate logistic regression analysis and also after adjusting for BMI, gender, age, and APACHE IV on multivariable logistic regression (OR = 0.65, CI: 0.44-0.96, p = 0.031). A PA < 4.8° was an independent predictor of 90-day mortality (adjusted OR = 3.65, CI: 1.34-9.93, p = 0.011). Conclusions: Phase angle at ICU admission is an independent predictor of 90-day mortality. This biological marker can aid in long-term mortality risk assessment of critically ill patients.},

abstract = {Purpose: Phase angle obtained using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) provides a relatively precise assessment of the nutritional status of elderly patients. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of phase angle as a risk factor for complications after gastrectomy in elderly patients. Materials and Methods: We evaluated 210 elderly patients (aged ≥65 years) who had undergone gastrectomy for gastric cancer between August 2016 and August 2017. The phase angle cutoff value was calculated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis according to sex. A retrospective analysis regarding the correlation between early postoperative complications and well-known risk factors, including the phase angle, was performed. Results: Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of two or more comorbidities (odds ratio [OR], 3.675) and hypoalbuminemia (OR, 4.059) were independent risk factors for overall complications, and female sex (OR, 2.993) was independent risk factor for severe complications. A low phase angle (OR, 2.901 and 4.348, respectively) and total gastrectomy (OR, 4.718 and 3.473, respectively) were independent risk factors for both overall and severe complications. Conclusions: Our findings show that preoperative low phase angle predicts the risk of overall and severe complications. Our findings suggest that BIA should be performed to assess the risk of postoperative complications in elderly patients with gastric cancer.},

Although no significant difference in PA was found in PKU patients compared to healthy controls (6,35 vs 6.89), a positive correlation was found between PA and phenylalanine levels in patients (r=0,457, p=0,032). Conclusions: Our data suggest PA does not differ between patients and controls, but shows correlation with Phe. In our study we did not find difference in BMI and body composition between patients and controls. An increase in the sample size is needed to confirm our findings.},

abstract = {Purpose: Phase angle (PA), determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), has been considered as a prognostic factor in several clinical conditions. The purpose of this study is to investigate PA, after adjusting for sex and age (standardized phase angle; SPA) as a prognostic factor for survival in cancer patients. Methods: A prospective study was conducted in 195 patients before the first chemotherapy course. BIA was performed in all patients and SPA was calculated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate survival. The Cox regression method was used to evaluate the independent prognostic effect of PA after adjustment for other variables. Results: Patients with SPA < -1.65 had a smaller survival rate than those with SPA ≥ -1.65 (p < 0.001). Using Cox regression, the mortality rate was higher in patients with SPA < -1.65 (RR 3.12 CI: 2.03-4.79; p < 0.001). After multivariate analysis, patients with PA < -1.65 still presented a higher mortality rate (RR 2.35 CI: 1.41-3.90; p = 0.001). Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that PA, used as SPA, is an independent prognostic indicator in this group of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy treatment even after adjustment for other prognostic variables. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {AbstractBioimpedance analysis (BIA) has been widely used in the evaluation of body composition in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. We conducted this study to evaluate impact of phase angle (PA) and sarcopenia measured by BIA on clinical prognosis in these patients.This longitudinal retrospective study enrolled patients who underwent hemodialysis between January 2016 and March 2019. The patients were stratified into higher (> 4°) and lower (≤ 4.0°) PA groups. Sarcopenia was defined when the appendicular skeletal muscle mass was < 20 kg in men and < 15 kg in women.Of the 191 patients, 63.4% were men. The mean age was 64.2 ± 12.4 years. The lower PA group was older, had a higher proportion of women, a lower body mass index, lower albumin, cholesterol, uric acid, and phosphorus levels, and a higher incidence of history of coronary artery disease than the higher PA group. Linear regression analysis revealed that PA was significantly associated with body mass index (B = 0.18, P = .005), serum albumin (B = 0.23, P = .001), and creatinine levels (B = 0.32, P < .001). During a median follow-up of 16.7 months, 14.1% (n = 27) of patients experienced major adverse cardiovascular events and 11.0% (n = 21) died. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the higher PA group had significantly better survival, regardless of sarcopenia. Multivariate Cox analyses revealed that lower PA (0.51 [0.31-0.85], P = .010), higher IDWG (1.06 [1.01-1.12], P = .028) and C-reactive protein level (1.01 [1.01-1.02], P < .001), and a history of coronary artery disease (3.02 [1.04-8.77], P = .042) were significantly related to all-cause mortality after adjusting for other covariates.PA measured by BIA was an independent factor in the prediction of mortality in maintenance hemodialysis patients, regardless of sarcopenia. Intervention studies are needed to confirm if the improvement in PA is associated with better clinical outcome.},

abstract = {Objectives: Malnutrition in CF patients is associated with severe lung disease and worse survival. Body mass index (BMI) is a well-known marker of nutritional status. PA is the most established impedance parameter for the diagnosis of malnutrition and clinical prognosis in different diseases; it documents the quality of soft tissue mass. The aim of this study was to investigate which is the better indicator of nutritional status in children with CF. Methods: In a prospective study we evaluated BMI Z-score, PA Z-score, FEV1, exercise capacity (EC; peak cycle exercise testing, Godfrey protocol) and daily activity (DA, activity sensor “Sensewear armband” for 7 days) from all CF patients (6 to 17 years) coming routinely in our CF centre. Results: We analysed the following data (MW±SD) from 156 patients (78 males, 78 females), aged 11.3±3.4 years: BMI Z-score 0.5±0.9; PA Z-score 0.4±1.0, FEV1 90±19.6%, EC 93.5±20.6% of norm, DA (daily time with high activity, >6METs): 45.3±48.3 minutes. While the PA correlates with BMI Z-score (r = 0.186, p = 0.022) we found good correlations from BMI Z-score with FEV1 (r = 0.326, p<0.001) and EC (r = 0.299, p<0.001) and only a correlation between PA and EC (r = 0.289, p = 0.001). No correlations were found between BMI Z-score or PA and daily activity. Conclusions: Our results confirm the association between nutritional status and lung disease in children with CF. Patients in better nutritional status demonstrate higher EC. Increased activity doesn't influence the body composition in our young patients. It seems that measurement of PA from BIA isn't a better indicator for nutritional status and prognosis in CF children in good clinical status.},

abstract = {Purpose of review Malnutrition affects prognosis in many groups of patients. Although screening tools are available to identify adults at risk for poor nutritional status, a need exists to improve the assessment of malnutrition by identifying the loss of functional tissues that can lead to frailty, compromised physical function, and increased risk of morbidity and mortality, particularly among hospitalized and ill patients and older adults. Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) offers a practical approach to identify malnutrition and prognosis by assessing whole-body cell membrane quality and depicting fluid distribution for an individual. Recent findings Two novel applications of BIA afford opportunities to safely, rapidly, and noninvasively assess nutritional status and prognosis. One method utilizes single-frequency phase-sensitive measurements to determine phase angle, evaluate nutritional status, and relate it to prognosis, mortality, and functional outcomes. Another approach uses the ratio of multifrequency impedance values to indicate altered fluid distribution and predict prognosis. Summary Use of basic BIA measurements, independent of use of regression prediction models and assumptions of constant chemical composition of the fat-free body, enables new options for practical assessment and clinical evaluation of impaired nutritional status and prognosis among hospitalized patients and elders that potentially can contribute to improved patient care and clinical outcomes. However, these novel applications have some technical and physiological limitations that should be considered.},

abstract = {Introduction Malnutrition affects at least one in three hospital inpatients1. It prolongs hospital stay and affects the recovery process. Early detection and intervention are essential to tackling malnutrition. Current nutritional assessment tools are dependent upon clinician experience and vary in their detection rates of malnutrition. We assess whether bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived phase angle (PA), plasma markers such citrulline and pre-albumin could aid assessment and if current starving and resting protocols are required for BIA. Method Eighty adult in-patients were recruited over a 40 week period. The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) and Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) were performed. Serum was analysed for citrulline and pre-albumin. PA was measured using Bodystat 4000 in three different metabolic states: rested and fasted, post-exercise and post food and exercise. The reference standard for malnutrition was determined using SGA. MUST score >0 indicated malnutrition risk, severe if >2. PA was considered to define malnutrition if lower than reference ranges for sex and age; severe malnutrition was indicated as >2 integers below reference range. Statistical analysis included paired t test and logistical regression. Results 80 patients took part in the study; 47 (59%) male (20- 86 years) and 33 (41%) female (18-87 years). Sixty-six patients completed all arms of the study; Fourteen patients did not consent to a blood test but completed all other aspects. 1. SGA and PA identified 47 (59%) and 50 (63%) patients with malnutrition compared to 9 (11%) by MUST 2. SGA and PA identified 15 (19%) and 10 (13%) patients with severe malnutrition compared to 2 (0.03%) by MUST 3. Compared to SGA, PA had sensitivity of 91% (95% CI 80%>98%) and specificity of 36% (95% CI 11%>69%). Positive predictive value was estimated at 86% (95% CI 80% >91%). Negative predictive value was estimated at 50% (95% CI 23%>77%) 4. There were no food or exercise related difference in PA (p=0.1837; p=0.1344 respectively) 5. Pre-albumin co-related with SGA (p=0.003), citrulline did not (p=0.348) Conclusion These results show that BIA-derived PA is an objective measurement suitable for use in nutritional assessment. It is sensitive for detecting malnutrition and has a highly significant association with SGA. Furthermore, current fasting and resting protocols surrounding its use were found to be invalid. Pre-albumin is a useful biomarker in nutritional status assessment.},

abstract = {Phase angle (PA) and bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) have been recommended as useful prognostic markers in various clinical settings. However, reference data for older adults measured by the novel segmental multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (SMF-BIA) technique are currently lacking. This study examined 567 (286 men, 281 women) healthy older adults (65 – 97 years) and new SMF-BIA-based PA and BIVA reference values were generated stratified according to gender and 3 age groups (65 – 75 years, 76 – 85 years, > 85 years). Mean PA-values (women: 4.30 ± 0.6°, men: 4.77 ± 0.7°) were significantly lower than those previously reported for a younger reference population. Age and gender were significant determinants of PA and BIVA. PA showed a significant decrease with increasing age in both genders. The greatest changes occurred in the age group > 85 years. Men had higher PAs compared to women (except for the oldest age group), but showed a substantially steeper decline in PA, possibly due to a more pronounced reduction of muscle mass. Compared to published reference data for younger adults, there was a clear downward migration of the BIVA vector points in older adults, indicating an age-related reduction of body cell mass. Accordingly, the equation for the BIVA chart generation was modified by adding the factor age. In conclusion, this is the first study to present SMF-BIA-determined PA and BIVA reference data for healthy subjects aged ³ 65 years. These data can be used for clinical purposes to identify individuals at increased risk for adverse health events or to monitor treatment responses.},

Palliative care in these patients focuses on care aimed at improving quality of life. Phase angle (PA) is obtained by bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) and is associated with cellular function. It is considered a reliable marker of malnutrition. A low PA may suggest deterioration of the cell membrane, which in palliative patients may result in a short-term survival.

It remains unclear if the phase angle is associated protein-energy wasting (PEW) or frailty, which are common complication in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether BIA-derived PA is a marker of PEW or frailty in HD patients. Methods: This retrospective observational study included 116 adult HD patients (35% female, 64 ± 12 years of age) in a single dialysis center. Patients were classified according to the PA quartiles into four groups; 1) first quartile: PA < 3.7°, 2) second quartile: PA 3.7–4.1°, 3) third quartile: PA 4.2–4.9°and 4) forth quartile: PA ≥ 5.0°. International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM) criteria and Japanese version of Cardiovascular Health Study (J-CHS) criteria were used to identify PEW and frailty. Results: The lower PA group was associated with a greater risk of PEW (35% vs. 24% vs. 21% vs. 3%; p = 0.032), frailty (59% vs. 40% vs. 21% vs. 3%; p < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the first quartile group was at a significantly greater risk of both PEW and frailty compared with the fourth quartile group after adjusting for other confounding factors. Conclusions: Lower PA was associated with a greater risk of PEW and frailty in HD patients.},

abstract = {Objective Protein–energy wasting is common in patients on hemodialysis and is an independent risk factor for adverse events. The aim of this study was to retrospectively investigate whether phase angle (PA), known as a nutritional marker, can predict various clinical outcomes in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are receiving hemodialysis. Methods Using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), PA was obtained every 6 mo, and patients were divided into two groups according to baseline PA: group A included patients with PA ≥4.5° and group B included patients with PA <4.5°. Results We followed 142 patients for a median of 29 mo (12–42 mo). We found that a decrease in PA was associated with an increased risk for death that persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33–0.97). Cardiovascular events were not associated with PA (P = 0.685). We found that PA predicted the occurrence of infection, independent of age, sex, and comorbidities (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45–0.94). Although levels of hemoglobin did not differ between groups during the study period, patients in group B received higher doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and intravenous iron than those in group A (P = 0.004 and 0.044, respectively). In longitudinal analyses, we did not find increases in PA over time in patients who had a mean dialysis adequacy ≥1.4, daily protein catabolic rate ≥1.2 g/kg, or total carbon dioxide level ≥22 mmol/L. Conclusions PA assessed in a simple manner using BIA provides practical information to predict clinical outcomes in ESRD patients on maintenance hemodialysis.},

abstract = {Background: Phase angle (PhA) value determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is an indicator of cell membrane damage and body cell mass. Recent studies have shown that low PhA value is associated with increased nutritional risk in various group of patients. However, there have been only a few studies performed globally assessing the relationship between nutritional risk and PhA in hospitalized geriatric patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate the predictive value of the PhA for malnutrition risk in hospitalized geriatric patients. Methods: One hundred and twenty-two hospitalized geriatric patients were included in this cross-sectional study. Comprehensive geriatric assessment tests and BIA measurements were performed within the first 48 h after admission. Nutritional risk state of the patients was determined with NRS-2002. Phase angle values of the patients with malnutrition risk were compared with the patients that did not have the same risk. The independent variables for predicting malnutrition risk were determined. SPSS version 15 was utilized for the statistical analyzes. Results: The patients with malnutrition risk had significantly lower phase angle values than the patients without malnutrition risk (p = 0.003). ROC curve analysis suggested that the optimum PhA cut-off point for malnutrition risk was 4.7° with 79.6 % sensitivity, 64.6 % specificity, 73.9 % positive predictive value, and 73.9 % negative predictive value. BMI, prealbumin, PhA, and Mini Mental State Examination Test scores were the independent variables for predicting malnutrition risk. Conclusions: PhA can be a useful, independent indicator for predicting malnutrition risk in hospitalized geriatric patients.},

abstract = {Introduction: Sarcopenia is common in liver transplant candidates and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Phase angle measurement from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) provides a means to assess for sarcopenia. Unlike computed tomography (CT) measurement of skeletal muscle, BIA is inexpensive and can be easily performed in an office setting. We evaluated the association between BIA measurements and outcomes of patients on our liver transplant waiting list. Methods: 106 consecutive patients evaluated for liver transplant from February 2015 to March 2016 underwent nutritional assessment testing using BIA. Patients with a phase angle ≤ 4.9 were identified as having sarcopenia (Ruiz-Margain 2015). Clinical data was retrospectively evaluated 18 months after the enrollment period. Data included pretransplant survival, transplant listing status, complications of liver disease, laboratory values and hospitalizations. Results: At the time of review, 72 (68%) patients were alive and 34 (32%) patients were transplanted. The average age was 58 ± 9 years and 66% were men. The three most common causes of liver disease were alcohol (36%), viral hepatitis (36%) and NASH (18%). 40% had hepatocellular carcinoma. The mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 14 ± 5 and complications of liver disease included hepatic encephalopathy in 57%, varices in 63%, refractory ascites in 20% and renal insufficiency in 29%. Diabetes was found in 39%, obesity in 55%, hypertension in 38% and dyslipidemia in 31%. Overall, sarcopenia was found in 31% of transplant candidates. Sarcopenic patients were older (61 ± 7 vs 57 ± 9 years, p=0.005) and had higher rates of renal insufficiency (45% vs 22%, p=0.014) and hepatic encephalopathy (73% vs 50%, p=0.029). There were no differences in MELD score, components of metabolic syndrome or other complications of liver disease based on muscle mass. Survival analysis is shown in Figure 1. Patients with normal muscle mass had improved survival compared to those with sarcopenia. Patients with sarcopenia had lower rates of transplant (15% vs 40%, p=0.012). In Cox regression analysis, age, pretransplant renal insufficiency, hepatic encephalopathy, MELD and sarcopenia were entered. Age and pretransplant renal insufficiency remained associated with survival, whereas sarcopenia was not. Conclusions: Patients with evidence of sarcopenia by BIA who underwent evaluation for liver transplantation were more likely to have complications of cirrhosis, increased mortality and a decreased likelihood of undergoing liver transplantation. As a measure of sarcopenia, BIA may be a useful prognostic tool in patients undergoing liver transplant evaluation. The possibility that sarcopenia may be more reflective of age and worsening renal function as causes of pretransplant mortality should be examined further. [Figure Presented]},

abstract = {Background. Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) surgery is by definition high risk (in hospital operative mortality risk of ≥5%) and contemporary validated risk assessment tools include the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system, Cardiopulmonary exercise (CPEX) testing and the Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity (POSSUM). More recently Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) and the calculated phase angle (PhA) has been championed as a prognostic factor in colo-rectal, pancreatic and lung cancer. Aim. The aim of this study was to determine the value of PhA as a risk assessment tool in UGI cancer surgery when compared with established validated surgical algorithms. Methods. Consecutive 50 patients (median age 66, 35 males, 29 esophageal and 21 gastric cancers) were studied prospectively. All patients underwent BIA (Maltron Bioscan 920) assessment pre-operatively and on post-operative days 1, 3 and 5, and Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (MedgraphicsTM CPX UltimaTM hardware; BreezesuiteTM and WelchAllyn{\textregistered} software) pre-operatively within an enhanced recovery after surgery programme. Primary outcome measures were post operative morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. Results. The median PhA was 7.28° (4.94° to 15.13°). PhA correlated significantly with patient demographic variables of age (p= 0.010), gender (p=0.018), ASA grade (p=0.029), deprivation score (p=0.006), percent fat free mass (p= 0.029), percent body fat (p=0.002) and muscle mass in kg (p=0.000). There were significant correlations with disease-related variables including tumour site (esophageal cancer median PhA 8.56° versus gastric cancer PhA of 7.19°, p=0.025), pathological N stage (p=0.020) and number of lymph node metastases (p=0.031). There was a universal reduction in PhA on the first post-operative day (median 1.21°, 15.3% reduction, range 0.20° to 4.23°). Preop PhA did not correlate with the incidence of post-operative morbidity, but the level of reduction in PhA correlated significantly with total hospital length of stay (P < .001). Conclusion. BIA correlated significantly with some but not all prognostic variables derived from established risk assessment tools. Further research is warranted in this arena to establish critical prognostic values and the precise role of BIA versus CPEX as a risk assessment tool.},

Methods: PhA was determined by BIA in patients (n = 983, 52.7 ± 21.5 yrs, M 520) and compared to healthy age-, sex- and height-matched controls. Low PhA was set at <5.0° (men) and <4.6° (women) as previously determined (Kyle, in press). Results: PhA was lower in patients (men 6.0 ± 1.4°, women 5.0 ± 1.3°) than controls (men 7.1 ± 1.2°, women 6.0 ± 1.2°, un-paired t-test p < 0.001). Patients were more likely to have low PhA than controls: NRS-2002: no risk (relative risk (RR) 1.7, 95th confidence interval (CI) 1.2-2.3), moderate risk (RR 4.5, CI 3.4-5.8) and severe risk (RR 7.5, CI 5.9-9.4); similar results were obtained by SGA; LOS ≥21 days (RR 6.9, CI 5.1-9.1) and LOS 5-20 days (RR 5.2, CI 3.9-6.9) and non-survivors (RR 3.1, CI 2.1-3.4) compared to survivors. Conclusions: There is a significant association between low PhA and nutritional risk, LOS and non-survival. PhA is helpful to identify patients who are at nutritional risk at hospital admission in order to limit the number of in-depth nutritional assessments. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.},

abstract = {Introduction: BIA estimation of fat-free mass is an indirect method to assess body composition for diagnosis of sarcopenia, but its accuracy is questionable. BIA-derived phase angle (PhA) is obtained from direct impedance measures and is a potential marker for sarcopenia. We aim to examine the association between PhA and muscle mass, strength and physical performance in non-frail communitydwelling older adults. Methods: We recruited 189 individuals (mean age 67.6 ± 7.5) who were non-frail by modified Fried criteria. We measured PhA and muscle mass using single frequency Quantum IV Body Composition Analyzer (RJL Systems, USA). Muscle parameters measured included skeletal muscle mass index (SMI, as measured by BIA and DXA), muscle strength (grip strength and knee extension) and physical performance (Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and gait speed). We examined the association of PhA with sarcopenia (EWGSOP criteria with Asian Working Group cutoffs). Multiple linear regression was performed for the association of PhA with muscle mass, strength and performance, adjusted for age and gender. Results: Thirty-one (16%) were sarcopenic. Mean PhA was lower in sarcopenic versus non-sarcopenic individuals (5.0 ± 0.6 vs 5.3 ± 0.7, P = 0.017). There was a strong positive correlation between PhA and BIA-derived SMI (r = 0.79, P<0.001), and a moderate positive correlation with DXA-derived SMI (r = 0.49, P<0.001). After adjusting for age and gender, PhA remained independently associated with BIA-and DXA-derived SMI (BIA: b = 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4, P<0.001, DXA: b = 0.4, 95% CI 0.21-0.57, P<0.001), muscle strength (handgrip strength: b = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-3.8, P<0.001, knee extension: b = 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4, P<0.001) and total SPPB score (b = 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6, P = 0.03), but not gait speed (b = 0.04, 95% CI-0.03 to 0.1, P = 0.26). Conclusions: Amongst non-frail community-dwelling adults, lower PhA is associated with impaired muscle mass, strength and physical performance. Further studies are required to assess the utility of PhA to diagnose sarcopenia.},

abstract = {Phase angle (PhA), a directly-measured bioelectrical impedance analysis variable, is suggested to be a proxy of body cell mass as well as extracellular/intracellular water ratio, and is related to cellular integrity and functions. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate PhA in healthy youths in relation to sex, age, weight status, physical fitness, and sports activities. A systematic literature search (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses criteria) until January 2022 was performed using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science regarding studies on PhA in healthy children and adolescents 4-18 years of age. Quality was assessed according to the National Institute of Health. After removing duplicates and studies not fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 22 cross-sectional and 1 longitudinal were considered appropriate. As for quality, 14 articles were rated fair and 9 good. Ten studies found that PhA increases with age: the increase was more marked after puberty, whereas changes in younger subjects are by far less defined. A clear sex difference was found in adolescents, likely due to pubertal development. Limited evidence suggests that PhA increases in participants with very high BMI. Limited data were reported on physically active youths without convincing findings. Positive associations of PhA with physical fitness and fat-free mass were found in few studies. In conclusion, partial and limited evidence suggests that changes in PhA over the first 2 decades of life reflect modification in body composition and fat-free mass composition. Further studies are needed for confirming PhA as a relevant marker of nutritional status in youths.},

abstract = {Background: Nutritional status can be difficult to assess. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived phase angle (PA), and the plasma markers citrulline and transthyretin (pre-albumin) have the potential to assist, but the protocol of fasting and resting for BIA renders the investigation impractical for routine use, especially so in populations at high risk of malnutrition. Aims: 1 To clarify whether starving and resting are necessary for reliable measurement of PA. 2 To identify whether PA, citrulline and transthyretin correlate with nutritional status. Methods: Eighty consenting adult in-patients were recruited. Nutritional status was determined by subjective global assessment (SGA) used as gold standard. The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) was used and anthropometric measurements were performed. Serum was analysed for citrulline and transthyretin. PA was measured using Bodystat 4000. The PA was considered to define malnutrition when lower than reference ranges for sex and age, and severe malnutrition if more than 2 integers below the lower limit. Anthropometric measurements were categorised according to WHO reference centiles. Ordinal logistic regression estimated the strength of association of PA, citrulline and transthyretin with SGA. PA values in the different metabolic states were compared using paired t tests. Results: All 80 subjects completed the BIA and the nutritional assessments in the 3 different states; 14 declined to provide blood samples for the biochemical assays. Malnutrition was identified in 32 cases, severe malnutrition in 14 cases, the remaining 34 cases were deemed not to be malnourished. PA was strongly inversely associated with SGA (Odds Ratio [OR] per unit increase = 0.21, CI 0.12–0.37, p < 0.001). PA was not influenced by exercise (p = 0.134) or food intake (p = 0.184). Transthyretin was inversely associated with malnourished/severely malnourished states (OR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.97–0.99, p = 0.001), but had poorer predictive values than PA. There was no significant association between citrulline concentration and SGA (OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.99–1.04, p = 0.348). Conclusions: The BIA-derived PA reliably identifies malnutrition. It is strongly associated with SGA but requires less skill and experience, and out-performs circulating transthyretin, rendering it a promising and less operator-dependent tool for assessing nutritional status in hospital patients. Our novel demonstration that fasting and bed-rest are unnecessary consolidates that position.},

abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to examine associations between phase angle (PhA) and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality in a healthy Danish subpopulation free of major chronic diseases. Methods: A random subset (n = 2601) of adult men and women born in 1922, 1932, 1942, and 1952 and examined in 1987 and 1988 were included, and followed over 24 y during which 643 men and 570 women developed CVD. Measures at baseline included age, weight, height, whole-body bioimpedance, from which PhA was calculated, and information on lifestyle, obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. The association between PhA and incident CVD was assessed by Cox proportional hazard model with age as the underlying time scale and with additional adjustment for covariates. To explore nonlinear associations, all results were presented using restricted cubic splines, with the median value of PhA as the reference. Results: PhA was lower among women who later developed CVD than among women who did not (6.3 vs. 6.0; P < 0.001). The highest risk of CVD was observed at the 5th percentile (hazard ratio: 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.60). Among men, PhA was not significantly associated with risk of CVD (7.1 vs. 7.0; P = 0.246). Conclusions: Among apparently healthy Danish men and women, a lower PhA value was associated with a higher incidence of CVD over 24 y, also after adjusting for potential confounders, and particularly among women. These findings may encourage the future use of PhA as an additional index in predicting CVD. However, more studies are needed to confirm our results.},

This study determined the cut-off values for PhA compared to Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS-2002) and Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) in patients at hospital admission, and evaluated the association between PhA and serum albumin. Methods: PhA was determined in patients (Men (M)/Women (W) = 382/267), and healthy age-, sex- and height-matched controls. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for PhA compared to NRS-2002, SGA and serum albumin. The cut-off values were assessed by receiver operator characteristics area under the curve (ROC-AUC). Results: The best PhA cut-offs were 5.0° and 4.6° in M/W. The sensitivity for NRS-2002 was 70.0/58.1% (M/W); SGA: 73.3/64.5%; albumin: 58.8/23.5%; specificity for NRS-2002: 85.1/81.7% (M/W); SGA: 76.6/76.1% and albumin: 93.2/96.6%. The PhA showed a ROC-AUC for NRS-2002 of 0.85/0.80 (M/W); SGA: 0.83/0.80 and albumin: 0.85/0.91. Patients with albumin levels <35. g/L had a relative risk of 7.5 to have low PhA compared to patients with ≥35. g/L. Conclusions: The consistent sensitivity and specificity between PhA and three screening tools strengthens the validity of our study. PhA appears to be a useful screening tool to assess nutritional risk without having to measure weight or height. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.},

abstract = {Maintenance and improvement of neuromuscular functions is crucial for everyone regardless of age. An easy way to assess neuromuscular properties without muscle contraction is useful especially for those who cannot perform strenuous muscular force production, such as older adults and patients with orthopedic or cognitive disorders. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) can assess body electrical properties e.g., phase angle (PhA) which is regarded as muscle quantity/quality index. The purpose of this study was to investigate associations of PhA with neuromuscular properties of the knee extensors in 55 young (n = 23) and older (n = 32) adults. The values of PhA of the right thigh and whole-body were determined with BIA at 50 kHz. The participants performed 4-s maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) to measure peak torque (PTMVIC), and 1-s brief MVIC to assess rate of torque development (RTD) over the time interval of 0–200 ms. As markers of physiological mechanisms of muscle force production, twitch contractile properties (peak twitch torque, rate of twitch torque development, and time-to-peak twitch torque) of the knee extensors obtained by femoral nerve electrical stimulation, and muscle activity assessed as root mean square values of electromyographic activity (EMG-RMS) during PTMVIC and RTD measurements were measured. Thigh and whole-body PhA significantly correlated with PTMVIC (r ≥ 0.555, p < 0.001) and electrically evoked twitch parameters (peak twitch torque, rate of twitch torque development, and time-to-peak twitch torque; |r| ≥ 0.420, p ≤ 0.001), but not RTD (r ≤ 0.237, p ≥ 0.081) or EMG-RMSs (|r| ≤ 0.214, p ≥ 0.117). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that thigh PhA was selected as a significant variable to predict PTMVIC but not RTD. Whole-body PhA was not selected as a significant variable to predict PTMVIC or RTD. In conclusion, both thigh and whole-body PhA can associate with maximal voluntary muscle strength of the knee extensors, and this association may be due to intrinsic contractile properties but not neural aspects. Regarding prediction of the knee extensor strength, thigh PhA is preferable as the predictor rather than whole-body PhA which is used as a widely acknowledged indicator of sarcopenia.},

abstract = {Rationale: This study determined if there is a significant association between phase angle (PhA), determined by BIA and nutritional risk determined by Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS-2002), Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), hospital length of stay (LOS) and 30 day nonsurvival in adults patients at hospital admission compared to healthy controls. Methods: PhA was determined in patients (n = 983, age 52.7±21.5 yrs, M/F 520/463) and compared to healthy age-, sex- and height-matched control subjects from our data base (n = 983, age 52.8±21.7 yrs). Phase angle was determined by 50 kHz tetrapolar skin BIA at hospital admission, prior to treatment. Low PhA was set at <.0° (men) and <.6° (women) as previously determined (Kyle, Clin Nutr submitted). Relative risk (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated by Fisher Exact Test 2×2 table. Results: PhA was significantly lower in patients (men 6.0±1.4°, women 5.0±1.3°) than controls (men 7.1±1.2°, women-6.0±1.2°, un-paired t-test p<.001). Patients were significantly more likely to have low PhA than controls: NRS-2002: no risk: RR 1.7, CI 1.2 2.3, moderate risk: RR 4.5, CI 3.4 5.8 and severe risk: RR 7.5, CI 5.9 9.4; by SGA: Well-nourished: RR 1.4, CI 1.0 2.1; moderately malnourished: RR 3.8, CI 2.9 4.9; severely malnourished: RR 7.2, CI 5.7 9.0; LOS >20 days: RR-6.9, CI 5.1 9.1 and LOS 5 20 days: RR 5.2, CI 3.9-6.9 and non-survivors: RR 3.1, CI 2.1 3.4 compared to survivors. Conclusion: Patients at hospital admission had significantly lower PhA than healthy controls. There is a significant association between low PhA and nutritional risk, LOS and non-survival. Thus PhA, which does not require measurement of body height or weight, is an indicator of nutritional risk status that can be used to evaluate nutritional risk in patients at hospital admission.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE(S): To explore the validity of using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived 50 kHz phase angle (PhA) in predicting protein-energy wasting (PEW) in Chinese maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: The design was a cross-sectional study. A total of 173 of MHD patients and 173 healthy adults were enrolled in the study. The prevalence of PEW in patients was performed by the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism criteria. The PhA, body cell mass, fat mass, body fat percentage, fat-free mass, and extracellular water/total body water were measured by InBody S10 body composition analyzer. The biochemical indices and anthropometric measurements were assessed using the way published elsewhere. The PhA, other values of BIA and its relationship with age, visceral protein, anthropometric measurements of the MHD patients were compared with the healthy group. The independent variables for predicting PEW and its cutoff values were explored using logistic regression model and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, respectively. RESULTS: The MHD patients' PhA value was significantly lower than the healthy group (4.89°± 1.19 vs. 6.32°± 2.23, P < .01). A total of 34.1% MHD patients with PEW had significantly lower PhA values compared with well-nourished patients (P < .05). The PhA decreased more significantly with age in MHD (r = -0.35, P < .001), compared with controls (r = -0.26, P < .001). The PhA values were positively associated with nutritional indices related to serum albumin, prealbumin, fat-free mass, and mid-arm muscle circumference. PhA values were not associated significantly with fat mass and body fat percentage (P > .05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that PhA and body mass index were independent predictors of PEW, but the PhA was the stronger predictor (odds ratio = 4.48, P < .05). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that the optimal PhA cutoff value to predict PEW was 4.6°. CONCLUSIONS: BIA-derived PhA appears to be a useful bioelectrical marker for predicting PEW in Chinese hemodialysis patients with a cutoff value of 4.6°.},

Bioimpedance phase angle (phase angle, PhA) is one of the parameters that can be measured using Bioimpedance body composition analysis (BIA). BIA, along with Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA), is used to determine lean body mass according to the EWGSOP2 sarcopenia diagnostic protocol. Modern studies note such positive aspects of BIA, as compared to DEXA, as the speed of diagnosis, no ionizing radiation exposure on the patient's body, the lower cost of the study with high information content. The phase angle shows the quality of cell membranes and metabolic activity. Low PhA is associated with the progression of frailty and sarcopenia, disability and poor outcomes for geriatric patients. This review of the literature is devoted to the consideration of modern aspects of the use of BIA with PhA measurement in geriatric practice.},

abstract = {Introduction: Phase angle derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis is a parameter that has been shown to be associated with sarcopenia and malnutrition in the elderly population. However, its relationship with frailty has not been adequately studied. Here, we aimed to investigate association between phase angle and frailty in elderly. Material and methods: One hundred and eighty-eight elderly patients (age over 65) were included in the study. All patients underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment. The frailty status of the patients were evaluated by Fried's Frailty Index which has five components including weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, low activity and slow speed walking. Those who had three or more positive results in this scale were considered "frail", 1-2 points were considered "pre-frail" and those who satisfied none of these criteria were considered "robust". All patients were evaluated by using bioelectrical analysis device to determine phase angles. Results: The median age of the patients were 74 years (min-max: 65-91) and 41.5% were female. The most common co-morbidities were hypertension (75.5%) and diabetes mellitus (41.0%). Mean ± SD phase angle was lower in frail group compared to pre-frail and robust groups (4.12±0.79 vs. 4.60±0.63 vs. 5.20±0.80, respectively) (p<0.001). The parameters which were significantly different (p<0.2) in univariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis and phase angle (OR: 0.360, p=0.018), age (OR: 1.132, p=0.020), mini-mental state examination (OR: 0.777, p<0.001) and Yesavage geriatric depression scale (OR: 1.307, p=0.002) were found to be independently associated with frailty. Receiver operating character-istic (ROC) analysis suggested that optimum cut-off point of phase angle for frailty was ≤4.00 with 54.8% sensitivity, 91.0% specificity, 54.8% positive predictive value and 91.1% negative predictive value (AUC: 0.751, p<0.001). Conclusion: Our results suggest that phase angle may be an independently associated factor for frailty. Further prospective studies are needed to investigate casual relationships between these entities.},

@article{DiVincenzo2021a,
abstract = {Introduction: Bioimpedance analysis (BIA)-derived phase angle (PhA) describes changes in the ratio body cell mass/fat-free mass (and therefore in muscle quality, as well). Obesity is associated with alterations in muscle structure, e.g. myosteatosis, and metabolic function. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate whether and to which extent PhA varies in adult patients with obesity. We focused on: a) changes in PhA due to obesity; b) changes in PhA after bariatric interventions or training programs in patient with obesity. Methods: A systematic literature search until February 2021 using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed according to PRISMA criteria. Selection criteria included studies on adult patients with obesity without comorbidities other than metabolic diseases. Results: A total of 278 articles were identified through the initial search. After removing duplicates and excluding studies that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria by screening titles and abstracts, the full text of the remaining 80 potentially relevant studies was examined. Twenty-one papers (11 cross-sectional and 10 longitudinal) met the inclusion criteria. Few studies have shown that PhA is lower in patients with obesity than in controls. Only one paper thoroughly evaluated PhA in different age groups, showing a decrease after the fourth decade of life in both genders. Four out of five studies reported consistently greater mean values in men than in women. In two studies PhA was lower in patients with obesity grade-III than in grade I-II. Additionally, patients with low PhA had higher BMI and PhA was significantly and inversely correlated with fat mass. Longitudinal studied showed that PhA markedly decreased after different bariatric surgery and slightly increased after training programs. Finally, no reference values (i.e. percentiles) are available for PhA in male or in female patients with obesity. Conclusion: So far, a relatively low number of studies have evaluated BIA-derived PhA in patients with obesity with partial, sometimes contradictory, and preliminary results. PhA may be useful to evaluate muscle quality in patients with obesity but further studies are needed to associate this variable with change in muscle structure and strength, as well as metabolic function.},

Although its biological meaning is still not clear, phase angle appears to have an important prognostic role. Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate population averages and SDs of phase angle that can be used as reference values. Design: BIA and other methods used to evaluate body composition, including hydrodensitometry and total body water, were completed in 1967 healthy adults aged 18-94 y. Phase angle was calculated directly from body resistance and reactance, and fat mass (FM) was estimated from the combination of weight, hydrodensitometry, and total body water by using the 3-compartment Siri equation. Phase angle values were compared across categories of sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and percentage FM. Results: Phase angle was significantly (P < 0.001) smaller in women than in men and was lower with greater age (P < 0.001). Phase angle increased with an increase in BMI and was significantly inversely associated with percentage fat in men. Phase angle was significantly predicted from sex, age, BMI, and percentage FM in multiple regression models. Conclusions: Phase angle differs across categories of sex, age, BMI, and percentage fat. These reference values can serve as a basis for phase angle evaluations in the clinical setting. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Society for Clinical.},

abstract = {Background: Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is gaining popularity as a body composition assessment tool for patients. Although it has been studied and validated in different populations, age groups, and clinical settings, including critically ill patients, there are concerns about BIA reproducibility and reliability in different device types and postures. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability of BIA according to different devices, postures, and lead types. Methods: Cross-sectional observational data of 74 healthy volunteers (32 women and 42 men) were collected. We used two types of devices, three types of postures (standing, sitting, and lying), and two lead types (clamp lead and adhesive lead) to measure the whole-body phase angle (phA) at a single frequency of 50 kHz. The measurements were validated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland–Altman plot analysis. Results: All phA measurements recorded with two types of devices, three different postures, and two types of leads were equivalent to each other (mean ICC = 0.9932, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9905–0.0053). The average mean difference in phA was 0.31 (95% CI 0.16–0.46). The largest phA value was measured using BWA with an adhesive-type lead in the lying position. There were no differences between standing and sitting positions. Conclusion: This is the first study to show the consistency and reliability of BIA in measuring phA using different devices, lead types, and postures. This could provide the confidence that BIA can be used in various clinical settings.},

abstract = {Introduction: Every year, over 600 thousands new cases of Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) are diagnosed. Progressive weight loss and malnutrition are generally found in those patients, especially under treatment (surgery, radiotherapy [RTH], chemotherapy [CTH]) conditions. Nutritional deficiencies have a significant influence on mortality and quality of life in patients with HNC. Bioelectrical impedance phase angle (PA) obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), as a measurable indicator of the body condition at the cellular level, is an alternative parameter to laboratory and anthropometric methods to measure and monitor nutritional status of patients with cancer. The aim of the study was to monitor the changes of PA in adult patients with HNC before each RTH cycle classified as well-nourished, moderately malnourished and severely malnourished according to the SGA scale and the effect of nutritional intervention on the value of PA. Methods: HNC patients were included in the study (n = 30, men, stages: I-IV). All participants were irradiated using IMRT technique (doses: 50-70Gy). Baseline assessment included: demographic, tumour related, nutritional and clinical evaluation as well as laboratory tests (albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, total protein), subjective global assessment (SGA) and PA measured by BIA at 4 frequencies (5/50/100/ 200 kHz) before each RTH cycle. Results: Significantly higher values of PA (50 kHz) have been found in SGA C patients when compared to those SGA A or B, before 6-th (5.48 vs 4.45; p = 0.0418) and 7- th cycle of RTH (5.56 vs 4.37; p = 0.0095). In patients treated with parenteral nutrition significantly higher values of PA (50 kHz) measured before 4-th (5.72 vs 4.25; p = 0.0124) and 5-th (5.48 vs 4.38; p = 0.0411) cycle of RTH were found. Conclusions: Our results have shown potential usefulness of PA measured by BIA in monitoring body composition changes related to treatment and to parenteral nutrition in patients irradiated due of HNC.},

abstract = {Background and aim Knowledge of fluid compartment changes and nutritional status is crucial when evaluating critically ill children, as well as measuring the effect of treatment. Current reference methods (DXA, dilution-methods etc.) are invasive, expensive, and/or time consuming and are therefore not suitable for routine paediatric examination. Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) offers an alternative to this since it is non-invasive, simple, portable and inexpensive. One BIA approach is to use values of total body fluid (TBF), extra- and intracellular fluid (ECF, ICF) and/or body cell mass (BCM). These are based on predictive equations and only proven in adults. Another approach is to use the phase angle (PA), which is a combination between the electrical resistance (R) of the electrolytic-containing TBF, and the capacitive reactance (XC) of the cell membrane, both expressed in ohms ($\Omega$). PA is an indicator of fluid compartment changes and cell membrane properties. Aim To investigate the relation between PA and weight (kg) and the body surface area, BSA (m2). Methods Whole-body BIA was performed in 47 healthy children (boys=33, girls=14, 0-14 yr). PA (arctan = XC/R, degrees) was measured at 50-kHz with a bioimpedance spectroscopy device (Xitron 4200). Statistics: Spearman's rank correlation (r), p < 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval. Results Data showed high positive correlations between PA and weight and BSA Correlation data of boys and girls combined Conclusions PA offers promising perspectives for further research areas (e.g. gender influence on PA). Potentially, PA could be a new way of monitoring fluid compartment changes and nutritional status in critically ill children. (Table Presented).},

abstract = {Background: Malnutrition, has impact on survival, quality of life and complication of cirrhosis. Assessment on the nutritional status in liver cirrhosis based on anthropometric measurement is not ideal and objective measurement like albumin serum is influenced by many factors. Examination by bioelectrical impedance analysis in chronic disease has been studied to assess the nutritional status and the phase angle as the prognostic parameters. Objectives: To determine the correlation between the phase angle and the Child Pugh score on patients with liver cirrhosis. Material and methods: Observational study was conducted using the cross-sectional measurement method. Patients with liver cirrhosis were examined for the anthropometric measurement, blood examination, abdomen ultrasound and the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) as well. Nutritional status was assessed by BMI, albumin and BIA parameters. The phase angle as one of the BIA parameters was then correlated statistically with the Child Pugh score using the Pearson correlation. Results: Of the 33 subjects of research, malnutrition based on the albumin serum<3.5 gr/dl was found on 25 patients (73.53%) with the percentage of Child Pugh A (3.68 ± 0.40 gr/dl) was only 25%, percentage of Child Pugh B (2.75 ± 0.52 gr/dl) was 82.26 % and 100% Child Pugh C (2.14 ± 0.4 gr/dl). The mean value of phase angle of Child Pugh A (6.53) was higher than those of Child Pugh B (5.24) and C (4.16) with a significant difference between Child Pugh A and C (p = 0.003). On the Pearson correlation test, a significant negative correlation between the Child Pugh score and the phase angle value (r = 0.522, p = 0.002) was obtained. Conclusion: The lower the phase angle value is, the higher the Child Pugh score will be. The prevalence on the malnutrition is still high on outpatients or hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis at H. Adam Malik hospital.},

abstract = {Background: Frailty is highly prevalent in the hemodialysis (HD) patient population (28-60%) and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Early frailty identification will allow earlier treatment interventions. The aim of the present study was to study phase angle (PA) measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as a predictor of frailty risk. Secondary aims were: a) evaluate the association between frailty and different factors, b) determine the prevalence of frailty among adult patients on hemodialysis. Methods: prospective cohort study performed between July 2021 and April 2022 in two Mexican HD centers. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was used to diagnose frailty. Using ROC curves, we determined the best cut-off for PA to predict frailty (Figure A). Pearson's correlation coefficient between PA and CFS score were calculated and univariate logistic regression analysis was performed (Figure B) Results: 78 patients were enrolled in this study. Participants were an average of 63.7 ± 14.3 years old with more male gender (62.8%) than female. 60.2% of participants were categorized as frailty. As expected, patients with frailty were older, had lower PA value and higher CFS score. Frailty was more prevalent in males and smokers. The AUC of PA to predict frailty was 0.87 (p<0.0001). Moderate-to-strong negative correlation was found between PA and CFS score (r=-0.58, p<0.0001). A univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the factors independently associated with frailty were the following: male (odds ratio [OR] = 3.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-8.35), age (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.08) and phase angle (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.34-0.75). Conclusions: A simple PA determination (<5.3) by BIA can predict risk of frailty (sensitive 85% and specificity 84%) in HD patients. The use of PA as a screening tool at no extra cost would allow early identification of frailty and referral for geriatric evaluation.},

The pemphigus disease area index (PDAI) score has been used as an accurate tool to assess the severity of pemphigus. This study aimed to evaluate the association between body composition, metabolic index, and phase angle by bioelectrical impedance in patients with Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and severity of disease based on the PDAI index. In this regard, 103 pemphigus patients and 125 healthy cases who were matched regarding their sex, age, and body mass index were chosen. Our results showed that there was a significant correlation between the phase angle and the sarcopenic index in patients with PV. Moreover, steroid dose had a significant correlation with the sarcopenia index; while it had no correlation with visceral fat area (VFA), BMI, volume load, percent body fat (PBF), and PhA. The volume load was lower but the phase angle and the sarcopenic index were higher in males, and females had a significantly higher BMI. Moreover, PBF and VFA were significantly higher in females compared to males. Besides, the patients treated with rituximab had lower PBF and higher sarcopenic index and volume loads compared to patients receiving other adjuvant treatments. In comparison to healthy controls, PV patients had a significantly higher VFA and PBF. Conclusively, the patients with PV had a significantly higher VFA and PBF compared to healthy objects. Moreover, the sarcopenic index was related to steroid dose and history of rituximab treatment.},

abstract = {Malnutrition is a major complication often observed in cirrhotic patients which has been associated with more severe disease, the arising of other cirrhosis-associated complications and mortality. Furthermore, alterations in inflammation-related components are of prognostic value in cirrhotic patients1. Phase angle (PA) is obtained from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), a noninvasive, inexpensive and reliable bedside tool for nutritional assessment based on conductivity properties of body tissues. In addition to identifying malnutrition, PA is also sensitive to changes in inflammatory markers2. To evaluate the association between malnutrition assessed through PA and mortality in cirrhosis. Methods: In a prospective longitudinal design, 134 cirrhotic patients completed clinical evaluations and nutritional assessment by BIA to obtain PA (where malnutrition = PA ≤4.9) during 3 years of follow-up. KaplaneMeier curves and multivariate Cox regression were used to assess malnutrition association with mortality. Results: Cirrhosis etiology was alcohol (59.0%), viral (20.1%), cryptogenic (11.8%) and others (9.0%); and Child and Meld indexes were 8.3 ± 2.0 and 14.4 ± 5.5, respectively. Mean follow-up was 2.1 years and mortality frequency was 44.26% for malnourished patients and 26.02% for those normally nourished. Malnutrition was associated with higher mortality rates (KaplaneMeier curve, p = 0.001) and was an independent factor to predict mortality, with a two-fold increase in risk of death (multivariate Cox Regression, HR = 2.1, 1.1-3.8 95% CI, p = 0.02). In our cirrhotic sample, a diagnosis of malnutrition established with BIA-measured PA was independently associated with mortality and may be a safe, practical and inexpensive tool to identify malnutrition-associated mortality risk in patients with cirrhosis.},

abstract = {Introduction ICU patients prognosis is evaluated at admission by severity scores (APACHEII, SAPSII) that are time-consuming. 50 kHz phase angle (PhA) is measured easily and quickly by bioimpedance analysis (BIA). Lowered PhA is associated with worse prognosis of chronic diseases. The main aim was to determine whether PhA measured at ICU admission predicts 28-day survival. Patients and methods Patients were recruited in 10 centers from 9 countries. The inclusion criteria were: age >18 years, absence of implantable cardioverter defibrillator or pacemaker, expected ICU length of stay >48 h. PhA was measured at admission (day (d) 1) by the Nutriguard (Data-Input, Germany) BIA analyzer. APACHEII and SAPSII were calculated at d1. The following variables were collected: 28-day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, infections, and expressed as mean ± standard deviations or median ± interquartiles accordingly. Relations between PhA and 28-day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay were analyzed by Kaplan- Meier actuarial curves and Spearman test. Sensitivity, specificity and PhA cutoffs associated with 28-day mortality were analyzed by ROC curves and the Youden method. Variables associated with 28-day mortality were determined by multivariate logistic regression. Results Thirty-three percentage of screened patients were analyzed: n = 918 (/1000 planned patients according to the power analysis sample calculation): Geneva, Switzerland (n = 178), Pelotas, Brazil (n = 103), Brussels, Belgium (n = 100), Vilnius, Lithuania (n = 100), Clermont-Ferrand, France (n = 99), Ljubljana, Slovenia (n = 96), Palma de Majorque, Spain (n = 94), Bydgoszcz, Poland (n = 52), Zagreb, Croatia (n = 49), Rouen, France (n = 47). The characteristics of analyzed patients were: 549 males, 61 ± 16 years, body mass index 26.4 ± 5.6, medical 63 %, shock all cause 29 %, APACHEII 19 ± 9, SAPSII 43 ± 19, PhA d1: 4.4 ± 1.7 degrees (°), 28-day mortality 21 %. Day 1 PhA was lower in non-survivors than in survivors (4.0 ± 2.0 vs 4.5 ± 1.7, P = 0.005). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of d1 PhA < 3.49 for 28-day mortality were, respectively, 49, 74, 31 and 86 % (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.63 [0.58-0.68]). The Kaplan-Meier actuarial curve indicated a better 28-day survival in patients with d1 PhA ≥ 3.49° (P < 0.001). Survival was worse in the quartile of patients with d1 PhA < 3.23° vs. quartiles (3.23-4.24, 4.25-5.32, > 5.32) (P < 0.001). Variables associated with d28 mortality were: SAPSII ≥ 46 (hazard ratio (HR) 4.2 [2.1-8.3], P < 0.001), PhA < 3.49° (HR 2.2 [1.3- 3.8], P = 0.005) and age >64 years (HR 1.9 [1.0-3.5], P = 0.05). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of a multivariate model associating d1 PhA < 3.49° and SAPSII ≥ 46 for 28-day mortality were 77, 66, 32 and 93 %, respectively (AUC = 0.78 [0.73-0.83]). There was a reverse correlation between d1 PhA and SAPSII (rho = -0.16), or APACHE II (rho = -0.19) (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with mechanical ventilation was higher in patients with PhA ≤ 4.2° vs. PhA > 4.2°: 50 vs 31 %, P < 0.001. There was no relation between PhA and ICU length of stay or infections. Conclusion At ICU admission PhA is an indicator of 28-day mortality, even if SAPSII is the best predictor. A combined multivariate model associating PhA and SAPSII improves 28-day mortality predictability.},

abstract = {Rationale: The choice of the best nutrition assessment method in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) remains a challenge. BIA is a potential instrument to evaluate muscular wasting and phase angle (PhA), which have been considered as important prognostic factors in liver diseases. Thus, we aimed to assess the muscle mass and PhA in patients with CHC. Methods: We included prospectively 148 consecutive CHC patients [77 (51.4%) males; mean age, 52.5 ± 11.6 yrs; 54 (36.5%) cirrhosis]. The diagnosis of liver diseases was based on standard clinical, biochemical, serological, radiological and histological parameters. Low PhA (<5th percentile) and muscle mass were measured by BIA. IPAQ was used to evaluate physical activity. Alcohol use and smoking were quantified. As a control group, we included 64 asymptomatic individuals who were matched by age and sex with CHC patients. Logistic regression analyses were used (SPSS 17.0). Results: Low muscle mass was found in 14 (21.9%) CHC patients [11(45.8%) with cirrhosis and 4 (10.0%) without cirrhosis] vs 6 (9.4%) asymptomatic individuals ( p < 0.0001). The low PhA was found in 21 (32.8%) CHC patients [13 (54.2%) with and 8 (20.0%) without cirrhosis] vs 7 (10.9%) asymptomatic individuals ( p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, adjusted by sex and age, cirrhosis (OR = 3.52; 95%CI = 1.15-10.80; p = 0.03) was independently associated with low muscle mass. Low PhA was independently associated with male sex (OR = 3.67; 95%CI = 1.32-10.19; p = 0.01) and cirrhosis (OR = 2.82; 95%CI = 1.20- 6.60; p = 0.02). Conclusion: In this study cirrhosis and male sex were associated with low muscle mass and PhA bellow the 5th percentile. These findings highlight the relevance of these BIA parameters as indicators of severity of liver disease stage in patients chronically infected by HCV.},

@article{Dang2021,
abstract = {Introduction: Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a simple, noninvasive method of assessing body composition. BIA operates by sending a low-voltage electric current through the body and measuring the impedance to that current. Parameters obtained from BIA have been used to investigate a range of variables such as nutrition and hydration status in a variety of patient populations. Phase angle is also a unique parameter that is thought to reflect cellular health. BIA parameters can undergo further analysis by bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) which can provide information about hydration status. Burn and critical care patients pose a unique challenge because they are particularly sensitive to fluid shifts and metabolic derangements which are associated with poorer outcomes. The utility of BIA and BIVA in this patient population has not been well studied. Thus, we have conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of the ability of BIVA and BIA parameters to assess cellular health and hydration status in critically ill adults and whether they can be correlated with outcomes. Methods: A search was performed on PubMed and Google Scholar in accordance with PRISMA guidelines between June 2020-August 2020 utilizing the keywords: bioelectrical impedance analysis, critical care, critical, body composition, phase angle, water, fluid. Inclusion criteria were articles investigating the relationship between BIA, BIVA and outcomes with regards to phase angle, hydration, and fluid status in critically ill adults. Reviews, non-English articles, and studies involving pediatric patients were excluded. A meta-analysis was conducted on the correlation between mean phase angle and mortality. Results: The final analysis included 21 articles; 4 articles were included in the meta-analysis. Statistically significant correlations were found between phase angle and mortality in 9/13 articles, hospital length of stay in 4/7 articles, ICU length of stay in 5/7 articles, and mechanical ventilation duration in 1/4 articles. For meta-analysis, mean phase angle in survivors and non-survivors was 4.5 and 3.9 respectively, and this difference was statistically significant (Figure 1, p< 0.01). Significant correlations were found between ECW/TBW and mortality in 4/7 articles, and BIVA derived hydration status and mortality in 6/7 articles. Conclusions: BIA and BIVA may be used as a prognostic indicator for outcomes in critical care patients. Further investigations are needed to explore this relationship in the burn patient population.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the most potent bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) marker of malnutrition and to adjust its application to hemodialysis (HD) patients.
DESIGN: An observational study.
SUBJECTS: A total of 99 patients on maintenance HD were enrolled in the study.
INTERVENTION: The nutritional state of the patients was examined before and after the HD procedure using Subjective Global Assessment Scale (SGA), serum albumin, body mass index and BIA-derived fat-free mass index, reactance, resistance, and phase angle (PA). Malnutrition defined by the SGA questionnaire was used to detect the most potent marker of malnutrition. This marker was further analyzed and corrected for the excess fluid, age, and gender producing the nutritional state-specific cutoffs.
RESULTS: The SGA rates of nutritional state were as follows: 57.6% (57) well nourished, 28.3% (28) moderately malnourished, and 14.1% (14) severely malnourished. Multivariate forward logistic regression analysis of the nutrition markers revealed PA as the most potent malnutrition predictor (odds ratio = 3.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.59-8.62; P = .002). PA was adjusted for the excess fluid (5.00 ± 0.97 vs 4.87 ± 1.08 P < .001). Patients were assigned into groups with adjusted PA values below the 5th through the 50th percentile of the mean PA reference value. The moderately malnourished patients were most accurately identified by the percentile group of <25th (area under the curve = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.60-0.81; P = .001), and the severely malnourished patients were most accurately identified by the percentile group of <15th (area under the curve = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62-0.85; P = .005).
CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is present almost in a half of the HD patients. BIA-provided PA is the most potent predictor of malnutrition. PA can be adjusted for the excess fluid after HD, age, and gender and used accordingly.},

abstract = {Background: Highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) reduces the risk of wasting in HIV infection and may alter the prognostic weight of wasting. The phase angle from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) can be interpreted as a surrogate marker for the catabolic reaction to chronic HIV infection and opportunistic disease. Objective: Our objective was to assess the prognostic ability of the phase angle in HIV-infected patients in the era of HAART. Design: Two cross-sectional observation studies were conducted in 1996 and 1997 at a German university outpatient HIV clinic. In the 1996 and 1997 cohorts, HAART was prescribed to 17 of 212 and 168 of 257 patients at baseline and to 179 of 212 and 234 of 257 patients during observation, respectively. Whole-body BIA was assessed at 50 KHz. Time to clinical progression and survival were calculated by using Cox proportional hazard models with time-dependent covariates. Median observation times were 1000 Aand 515 d for the 1996 and 1997 cohorts, respectively. Results: Higher phase angle was associated with a lower relative mortality risk, adjusted for viral load and CD4+ cell count, of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.81) per degree in 1996 and of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.61) in 1997. The influence of phase angle on time to clinical progression, adjusted for viral load and CD4+ cell count, was not significant in 1996 but the relative risk was 0.58 (0.36, 0.83) in 1997. Conclusion: Despite the favorable effects of HAART on the nutritional status of HIV-infected persons, low phase angle remains an independent adverse prognostic marker of clinical progression and survival.},

abstract = {Background: Sarcopenia is an important problem for older adults, leading to morbidity and mortality; therefore, early detection with a precise method is essential. We aimed to investigate the role of bioelectrical impedance analysis-derived phase angle as a determinant of sarcopenia. Materials and Methods: A cross section of 263 community-dwelling and hospitalized older adults (>65 years) were assessed in terms of sarcopenia with bioelectrical indices and anthropometric measurements. Sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic groups were compared, and significant determinants of sarcopenia were further analyzed with multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Forty patients were diagnosed with sarcopenia. The following were significant correlates of sarcopenia: female sex, low weight/height, low body mass index, decreased muscle strength, low calf circumference, low skeletal muscle mass/index, high impedance at 50 kHz, a history of hypertension, worse nutrition status, and low phase angle. Diagnostic parameters with well-known association were omitted, and sex, height, weight, body mass index, creatinine, nutrition status, phase angle, impedance at 50 kHz, and hypertension category were included in regression analysis. The following were independent associated factors with sarcopenia: phase angle (odds ratio [OR]: 0.59, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.40-0.87, P =.008), body mass index (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.77-0.93, P =.001) impedance at 50 kHz (OR: 1.010, 95% CI: 1.006-1.015, P <.001), and height (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88-0.97, P =.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the optimal phase angle cutoff value to detect sarcopenia was ≤4.55. Conclusions: Bioelectrical phase angle can be useful for diagnosis of sarcopenia.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) are important in the evaluation of nutritional status. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a simple, reproducible method used to determine FFM and FM. Because normal values for FFM and FM have not yet been established in adults aged 15 to 98 y, its use is limited in the evaluation of nutritional status. The aims of this study were to determine reference values for FFM, FM, and percentage of FM by BIA in a white population of healthy adults, observe their differences with age, and develop percentile distributions for these parameters between ages 15 and 98 y. METHODS: Whole-body resistance and reactance of 2735 healthy white men and 2490 healthy white women, aged 15 to 98 y, was determined by 50-kHz BIA, with four skin electrodes on the right hand and foot. FFM and FM were calculated by a previously validated, single BIA formula and analyzed for age decades. RESULTS: Mean FFM peaked in 35- to 44-y-old men and 45- to 54-y-old women and declined thereafter. Mean FFM was 8.9 kg or 14.8% lower in men older than 85 y than in men 35 to 44 y old and 6.2 kg or 14.3% lower in women older than 85 y than in women 45 to 54 y old. Mean FM and percentage of FM increased progressively in men and women between ages 15 and 98 y. The results suggested that the greater weight noted in older subjects is due to larger FM. CONCLUSIONS: The percentile data presented serve as reference to evaluate deviations from normal values of FFM and FM in healthy adult men and women at a given age.

abstract = {The use of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is widespread both in healthy subjects and patients, but suffers from a lack of standardized method and quality control procedures. BIA allows the determination of the fat-free mass (FFM) and total body water (TBW) in subjects without significant fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, when using appropriate population, age or pathology-specific BIA equations and established procedures. Published BIA equations validated against a reference method in a sufficiently large number of subjects are presented and ranked according to the standard error of the estimate.The determination of changes in body cell mass (BCM), extra cellular (ECW) and intra cellular water (ICW) requires further research using a valid model that guarantees that ECW changes do not corrupt the ICW. The use of segmental-BIA, multifrequency BIA, or bioelectrical spectroscopy in altered hydration states also requires further research.ESPEN guidelines for the clinical use of BIA measurements are described in a paper to appear soon in Clinical Nutrition. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BIA is easy, non-invasive, relatively inexpensive and can be performed in almost any subject because it is portable. Part II of these ESPEN guidelines reports results for fat-free mass (FFM), body fat (BF), body cell mass (BCM), total body water (TBW), extracellular water (ECW) and intracellular water (ICW) from various studies in healthy and ill subjects. The data suggests that BIA works well in healthy subjects and in patients with stable water and electrolytes balance with a validated BIA equation that is appropriate with regard to age, sex and race. Clinical use of BIA in subjects at extremes of BMI ranges or with abnormal hydration cannot be recommended for routine assessment of patients until further validation has proven for BIA algorithm to be accurate in such conditions. Multi-frequency- and segmental-BIA may have advantages over single-frequency BIA in these conditions, but further validation is necessary. Longitudinal follow-up of body composition by BIA is possible in subjects with BMI 16-34 kg/m2 without abnormal hydration, but must be interpreted with caution. Further validation of BIA is necessary to understand the mechanisms for the changes observed in acute illness, altered fat/lean mass ratios, extreme heights and body shape abnormalities. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Aims: To analyze the association of classic and specific bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) and phase angle with reference techniques for the assessment of body composition in athletes. Methods: 202 athletes of both sexes (men: 21.5 ± 5.0; women: 20.7 ± 5.1) engaged in different sports were evaluated during the in-season period. Bioelectrical resistance (R, ohm) and reactance (Xc, ohm) were obtained with a phase-sensitive 50 kHz bioelectrical impedance analysis device. The classic and specific BIVA procedures, which respectively correct bioelectrical values for body height (R/H and Xc/H, ohm/m) and body geometry (Rsp and Xcsp, ohm cm), were applied. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry was used as the reference method to assess fat-mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and %FM. Deuterium dilution and bromide dilution where used as the criterion method for total body water (TBW) and extracellular water (ECW), respectively. Intracellular water (ICW) was calculated as TBW minus ECW. Results: Specific bioelectrical values (Rsp, Xcsp, Zsp) were positively correlated with FM and %FM (%FM; Zsp men: r = 0.569, p < 0.001; Zsp women: r = 0.773, p < 0.001). Classic values (R/H, Xc/H, Z/H) were negatively correlated with FM and FFM, but were correlated with %FM only in men (Z/H men: r = −0.214, p = 0.013; Z/H women: r = 0.218, p = 0.097). As to body fluid, classic BIVA showed strong associations (Z/H men: r = −0.880, p < 0.001; Z/H women: r = −0.829, p < 0.001) with TBW, whereas Zsp was not correlated. Phase angle was negatively correlated with ECW/ICW ratio in both sexes (men: r = −0.493, p < 0.001; women: r = −0.408, p < 0.001) and positively with ICW (men: r = 0.327, p < 0.001; women: r = 0.243, p = 0.080). Conclusions: Specific BIVA turns out to be more accurate for the analysis of %FM in athletes, while it does not correctly evaluate TBW, for which classic BIVA appears to be a suitable approach. Phase angles, and hence both BIVA approaches, can detect ECW/ICW changes.},

abstract = {Background & aims: Severe acute COVID-19 has taken on pandemic proportions with growing interest in identification of prognostic factors for mortality. Standardized bioelectrical impedance (BI) phase angle (SPhA), which is PhA adjusted by age and sex, has been related to mortality in patients with several diseases but never investigated in COVID-19. Inflammation, a consequence of COVID-19 infection, affects fluid status (hydration) and can be identified with PhA. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive role of PhA on 90 days survival of adults with COVID-19. Methods: We studied 127 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19. BI measurements determined with a 50 kHz phase-sensitive BI device, body composition parameters and laboratory markers were evaluated as predictors of mortality. Results: Non-surviving COVID-19 patients had significantly lower PhA and SPhA values (p < 0.001) and increased hydration (p < 0.001) compared to surviving patients. Patients in the lowest SPhA quartile had increased (p < 0.001) mortality and hospital stay, hyperhydration (p < 0.001), increased inflammation biomarkers [CRP (p < 0.001)], decreased nutritional parameters: body mass cell index [BCMI (p < 0.001) albumin (p < 0.001)], and reduced other biomarkers [D-dimer (p = 0.002)]. Multivariate analysis (Cox regression) revealed that PhA and hydration status, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia or heart disease, were associated (p < 0.001) with increased mortality. The hazard ratio was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.60–3.84, p < 0.001) for PhA and 1.12 (95% CI, 1.04–1.20, p = 0.003) for hydration percentage. PhA <3.95° was the cut-off for predicting mortality in acute COVID-19 with 93.8% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity. PhA offers greater sensitivity as a predictive prognostic test at admission, compared to the established analytical parameters of poor prognosis (CRP, lymphocytes, prealbumin). Conclusions: Low PhA (<3.95°), independent of age, sex, BMI, and comorbidities, is a significant predictor of mortality risk in COVID-19. These findings suggest that the evaluation of body composition with single-frequency phase-sensitive BI measurements should be included in the routine clinical assessment of COVID-19 patients at hospital admission to identify patients at increased mortality risk.},

abstract = {Several markers have been associated with sarcopenia in the elderly, including bioelectrical indices. Phase angle (PhA) is an impedance parameter and it has been suggested as an indicator of cellular death. Thus, the relationship between PhA and muscle mass and strength was investigated in 207 consecutively elderly participants (mean age 76.2 ± 6.7. years) admitted for multidimensional geriatric evaluation. Muscle strength by grip strength using a hand-held dynamometer and muscle mass was measured by bioimpedentiometer. PhA was calculated directly with its arctangent (resistance. /. reactance. ×. 180°. /. $\pi$). Linear relationship among muscular mass and strength and with clinical and biochemical parameters, including PhA at uni- and multivariate analysis were performed. Linear regression analysis demonstrated that lower level of PhA is associated with reduction in grip strength (y = 3.16. +. 0.08x; r = 0.49; p. <. 0.001), and even more, with muscle mass (y = 3.04. +. 0.25x; r = 0.60; p. <. 0001). Multivariate analysis confirms these relationships (grip strength $\beta$ = 0.245, p = 0.031; muscular mass $\beta$ = 0.623, p. <. 0.01). Thus, PhA is inversely related to muscle mass and strength in elderly subjects and it may be considered a good bioelectrical marker to identify elderly patients at risk of sarcopenia. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Objectives: We investigated the impact of low phase angle (PhA) values on muscle strength, quality of life, symptom severity, and 1-year mortality in older cancer patients. Design: Prospective study with 1-year follow-up. Participants: Cancer patients aged >60years. Methods: PhA was derived from whole body impedance analysis. The fifth percentile of age-, sex-, and body mass index-stratified reference values were used as cut-off. Quality of life was determined with the European Organization of Research and Treatment in Cancer questionnaire, reflecting both several function scales and symptom severity. Muscle strength was assessed by hand grip strength, knee extension strength, and peak expiratory flow. Results: 433 cancer patients, aged 60-95years, were recruited. Patients with low PhA (n=197) exhibited decreased muscle strength compared with patients with normal PhA (hand grip strength: 22±8.6 vs 28.9±8.9kg, knee extension strength: 20.8±11.8 vs 28.1±14.9kg, and peak expiratory flow: 301.1±118 vs 401.7±142.6L/min, P<.001). Physical function, global health status, and role function from the European Organization of Research and Treatment in Cancer questionnaire were reduced, and most symptoms (fatigue, anorexia, pain, and dyspnea) increased in patients with low PhA (P<.001). In a risk-factor adjusted regression analysis, PhA emerged as independent predictor of physical function ({\ss}:-0.538, P=023), hand grip strength ({\ss}:-4.684, P<.0001), knee extension strength ({\ss}:-4.548, P=035), and peak expiratory flow ({\ss}:-66.836, P<.0001). Low PhA moreover predicted 1-year mortality in the Cox proportional hazards regression model, whereas grip strength was no longer significant. Conclusions: PhA below the fifth reference percentile is highly predictive of decreased muscle strength, impaired quality of life, and increased mortality in old patients with cancer and should be evaluated in routine assessment.},

Strategies for weight management include behavioral, pharmacological, and surgical interventions, all of which can result in a reduction in obesity-related comorbidities and improvements in quality of life. However, subsequent weight regain often reduces the durability of these improvements. The objective of this article is to review evidence supporting the long-term effects of intentional weight loss on morbidity, mortality, quality of life, and health-care cost. Overall, considerable evidence suggests that intentional weight loss is associated with clinically relevant benefits for the majority of obesity-related comorbidities.

abstract = {The pandemic rise in obesity has resulted in an increased incidence of metabolic complications. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and has become the most common chronic liver disease in large parts of the world. The adipose tissue expansion and hepatic fat accumulation characteristics of these disorders compromise local oxygen homeostasis. The resultant tissue hypoxia induces adaptive responses to restore oxygenation and tissue metabolism and cell survival. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) function as master regulators of this hypoxia adaptive response, and are in turn hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). PHDs are the main cellular oxygen sensors and regulate HIF proteasomal degradation in an oxygen-dependent manner. HIFs and PHDs are implicated in numerous physiological and pathological conditions. Extensive research using genetic models has revealed that hypoxia signaling is also a key mechanism in adipose tissue dysfunction, leading to adipose tissue fibrosis, inflammation and insulin resistance. Moreover, hypoxia affects liver lipid metabolism and deranges hepatic lipid accumulation. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms through which the hypoxia adaptive response affects adipocyte and hepatic metabolism, and the therapeutic possibilities of modulating HIFs and PHDs in obesity and fatty liver disease.},

Severely obese people with NAFLD are more likely to have advanced histologic forms of NAFLD than those with less severe forms of obesity. In general, serum ALT levels do not correlate with hepatic histology in the severely obese with NAFLD. Older age, higher BMI, and the presence of diabetes mellitus predict advanced hepatic histology in severely obese patients with NAFLD. Weight loss induced by gastric weight loss surgery or very low calorie diets leads to significant improvement in hepatic steatosis but in some patients it may lead to worsening hepatic inflammation or fibrosis. In the severely obese who are subjected to a very low calorie diet, the target weight loss should be less than 1.6 kg/week.},

NAFLD significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality in developed societies. Insulin resistance associated with central obesity is the major cause of hepatic steatosis, which is characterized by excessive accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipid droplets in the liver. Accumulating evidence supports that dysregulation of adipose lipolysis and liver de novo lipogenesis (DNL) plays a key role in driving hepatic steatosis. In this work, we reviewed the molecular mechanisms responsible for enhanced adipose lipolysis and increased hepatic DNL that lead to hepatic lipid accumulation in the context of obesity. Delineation of these mechanisms holds promise for developing novel avenues against NAFLD.},

abstract = {Fatty acid (FA) metabolism is a series of processes that provide structural substances, signalling molecules and energy. Ample evidence has shown that FA uptake is mediated by plasma membrane transporters including FA transport proteins (FATPs), caveolin-1, fatty-acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, and fatty-acid binding proteins. Unlike other FA transporters, the functions of FATPs have been controversial because they contain both motifs of FA transport and fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS). The widely distributed FATP4 is not a direct FA transporter but plays a predominant function as an ACS. FATP4 deficiency causes ichthyosis premature syndrome in mice and humans associated with suppression of polar lipids but an increase in neutral lipids including triglycerides (TGs). Such a shift has been extensively characterized in enterocyte-, hepatocyte-, and adipocyte-specific Fatp4-deficient mice. The mutants under obese and non-obese fatty livers induced by different diets persistently show an increase in blood non-esterified free fatty acids and glycerol indicating the lipolysis of TGs. This review also focuses on FATP4 role on regulatory networks and factors that modulate FATP4 expression in metabolic tissues including intestine, liver, muscle, and adipose tissues. Metabolic disorders especially regarding blood lipids by FATP4 deficiency in different cell types are herein discussed. Our results may be applicable to not only patients with FATP4 mutations but also represent a model of dysregulated lipid homeostasis, thus providing mechanistic insights into obesity and development of fatty liver disease.},

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely linked to obesity and is an emerging health problem, it originates from abnormal accumulation of triglycerides in the liver, and sometimes causes inflammatory reactions that could contribute to cirrhosis and liver cancer, thus its pathogenesis needs to be clarified for more treatment options. Once NAFLD is established, it contributes to systemic inflammation, the low-grade inflammation is continuously maintained during NAFLD causing impaired resolution of inflammation in obesity, which subsequently exacerbates its severity. This study focuses on the effects of obesity-induced inflammations, which are the underlying causes of the disease progression and development of more severe inflammatory and fibrotic stages. Understanding the relationship between obesity and NAFLD could help in establishing attractive therapeutic targets or diagnostic markers in obesity-induced inflammation response and provides new approaches for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD in obesity.},

abstract = {The combination of hypertension, obesity and non-Alcoholic fatty liver disease occurs in medical practice very often. A number of studies have shown that non-Alcoholic fatty liver disease increases the risk of cardiovascular disease independently of other predictors and manifestations of the metabolic syndrome. Current issues of research and identification of common pathogenic relationships of obesity, hypertension, and liver steatosis are investigated in the article. According to the analysed literature, it is indicated that insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia are considered as one of the key factors in the development of this comorbidity. The processes of chronic inflammation are increasing with the growth of adipose tissue volume. Some researchers believe that non-specific systemic inflammation combines arterial hypertension, increased body weight (especially abdominal obesity), steatosis, dyslipidaemia, atherogenesis and arteriosclerosis into a single syndrome. The role of non-Alcoholic fatty liver disease in the growth of the thickness of the intima-media complex was studied. It is known that adipose tissue functions as an endocrine organ, expresses genes encoding bioactive substances, and secretes certain cytokines. A strong link between dysfunction of adipose tissue in patients with non-Alcoholic fatty liver disease and in such conditions as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease was demonstrated. The dysfunction of the endothelium is also advisable to consider as the connecting link between liver disease, obesity and hypertension. Despite some understanding of common pathogenic mechanisms for the development of non-Alcoholic fatty liver disease and hypertension, this comorbid pathology remains the subject of much debate and a variety of studies.},

The prevalence of NAFLD has been on the rise in many parts of the world, including Asia, and NAFLD is now the liver disease associated with the highest mortality, consequent to the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. Whereas NAFLD is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, increased hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance contribute to the pathogenesis of both NAFLD and diabetes, which are associated with enhanced cardiovascular risk. Studies in humans and animal models have suggested obesity as the common link of these two diseases, likely mediated by adipose tissue inflammation and dysregulated adipokine production in obesity. In the present review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the role of several novel adipokines (adiponectin, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein and fibroblast growth factor-21) in the pathophysiology of NAFLD and diabetes, as well as their use as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for dysglycemia in NAFLD patients. {\textcopyright} 2013 Asian Association for the Study of Diabetes and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

abstract = {Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon like peptide (GLP-1) are the two incretin hormones secreted by the enteroendocrine system in response to nutrient ingestion. Compared with GLP-1, GIP is less well studied as a hormone or as a potential pharmacological treatment. Beyond its insulinotropic effects in the pancreas, GIP has important biological actions in many other tissues but its role in dietary fat metabolism and lipid storage in adipose tissue has been most studied. It is still unclear if such effects of GIP on adipose tissue/fat metabolism are protective or deleterious in the long term. Antagonising GIP actions through genetic and chemical disruption in mice models prevented diet induced obesity and improved insulin sensitivity. Whilst such effects of GIP antagonism are yet to be evaluated in humans, recent studies using combined GIP and GLP-1 agonists have shown weight reduction and improved glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Therapeutic manipulation of GIP physiology is intriguing in that both agonists and antagonists of GIP are being investigated to explore their potential weight-reducing and other metabolic benefits in people with obesity, T2D and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This review will discuss the physiological effects of GIP on fat metabolism in human adipose and other non-adipose tissues such as liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle and heart, describe where the actions of GIP may contribute to the pathophysiology of obesity, T2D and NAFLD and finally describe the therapeutic implications of GIP antagonism and agonism in these conditions.},

In this perspective, the development of insulin resistance is now recognized to be initiated by inflammation of the adipose tissue, but the events that lead to this inflammation are still vague. Furthermore, visceral adipose tissue plays a significant role in obesity pathophysiology and in its clinical effects, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Among the possible mechanisms linking NAFLD and obesity, we focused on Visfatin/NAMPT, mostly produced by macrophages infiltrated in adipose tissue and a biomarker of the inflammatory cascade affecting hepatic inflammation in NAFLD. We also addressed the signalling pathway triggered by the binding of VEGF-B to its receptor, which mediates lipid fluxes throughout the body, being a promising target to prevent ectopic lipid accumulation. We reviewed the available literature on the topic and we suggest a crosstalk between adipose tissue inflammation and NAFLD in order to provide new insights about the putative mechanisms involved in the development of NAFLD in the obesity context. A better understanding of the pathophysiological processes underlying NAFLD will allow the development of new therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {Obesity is currently a worldwide epidemic, and will likely only increase in prevalence in the coming years. The incidence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) seems to be paralleling obesity. The MetS is strongly linked to insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of obesity and the MetS. Although not currently a formal component of the MetS, data suggest a very strong correlation between NAFLD and the MetS; insulin resistance appears to be the common factor. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more advanced stage in the spectrum of NAFLD, which can progress to cirrhosis. Management strategies for NAFLD are conceivably similar to those for the MetS, which focus on lifestyle measures aimed at weight reduction and maintenance. The purpose of this review is to highlight the growing epidemic of obesity and the MetS, and the strong likelihood of an increase in the prevalence of the already widely existent combination of NAFLD/NASH. This article describes pharmacological treatments including novel therapies aimed at the hepatic pathophysiologic process, as well as surgical options. The increasing prevalence of obesity and the MetS places a large population at risk for developing hepatic failure. Therefore, NAFLD must be acknowledged as a major worldwide public health concern. {\textcopyright} Postgraduate Medicine.},

abstract = {Introduction: A number of researches have explored the association between obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) liver function, histopathology, complications, genetic factors and prognosis, but the results were conflicting and inconclusive. Areas covered: In this meta-analysis, the liver function, histopathology, metabolic complications, patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) genetic polymorphism and prognosis were compared between non-obese and obese NAFLD. Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane databases were searched to identify eligible studies. The odds ratio (OR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using fixed- or random-effects models. Expert commentary: This meta-analysis indicated that for NAFLD patients, obesity (according to ethnic-specific BMI cut-off points to define obesity) could predict a worse long-term prognosis. However, obesity may not be an independent factor for the development of NASH or advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients and NAFLD should be considered as potential population for pharmacologic treatment regardless of obesity. In addition, PNPLA3 rs738409 may be more relevant to the progression of non-obese NAFLD when compared to obese NAFLD. Importantly, large-sample, long-term follow-up cohort studies based on liver biopsy are highly needed due to limited liver pathology and long-term follow-up data at present.},

abstract = {Adiponectin, a soluble adipocytokine, plays an important role in the functioning of adipose tissue and in the regulation of inflammation, particularly hepatic inflammation. The adiponectin subsequently imparts a crucial role in metabolic and hepato-inflammatory diseases. The most recent evidences indicate that lipotoxicity-induced inflammation in the liver is associated with obesity-derived alterations and remolding in adipose tissue that culminates in most prevalent liver pathology named as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A comprehensive crosstalk of adiponectin and its cognate receptors, specifically adiponectin receptor-2 in the liver mediates ameliorative effects in obesity-induced NAFLD by interaction with hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Recent studies highlight the implication of molecular mediators mainly involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and obesity-driven NAFLD, however, the plausible mechanisms remain elusive. The present review aimed at collating the data regarding mechanistic approaches of adiponectin and adiponectin-activated PPARs as well as PPAR-induced adiponectin levels in attenuation of hepatic lipoinflammation. Understanding the rapidly occurring adiponectin-mediated pathophysiological outcomes might be of importance in the development of new therapies that can potentially resolve obesity and obesity-associated NAFLD.},

abstract = {Purpose of the Review: Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been proposed to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of a considerable number of disorders, such as neurodegeneration, cancer, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders, including obesity-related insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that undergo functional and structural adaptations to meet the metabolic requirements of the cell. Alterations in nutrient availability or cellular energy needs can modify their formation through biogenesis and the opposite processes of fission and fusion, the fragmentation, and connection of mitochondrial network areas respectively. Herein, we review and discuss the current literature on the significance of mitochondrial adaptations in obesity and metabolic dysregulation, emphasizing on the role of hepatocyte mitochondrial flexibility in obesity and NAFLD. Recent Findings: Accumulating evidence suggests the involvement of mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics dysregulations to the emergence of NAFLD and its progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Summary: Most relevant data suggests that changes in liver mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics hold a key role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. During obesity and NAFLD, oxidative stress occurs due to the excessive production of ROS, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. As a result, mitochondria become incompetent and uncoupled from respiratory chain activities, further promoting hepatic fat accumulation, while leading to liver inflammation, insulin resistance, and disease's deterioration. Elucidation of the mechanisms leading to dysfunctional mitochondrial activity of the hepatocytes during NAFLD is of predominant importance for the development of novel therapeutic approaches towards the treatment of this metabolic disorder.},

abstract = {The association of obesity with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been established. Obesity has been linked not only to initial stages of the disease, i.e., simple steatosis (SS), but also to its severity. From an epidemiologic point of view, both diseases has an increasing prevalence worldwide. From a pathogenetic point of view, obesity and its associate IRcontribute to the initial fat accumulation in the hepatocyte (SS), but also to the progression of SS to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), NASH-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). From a clinical point of view, obesity has increased morbidity and mortality when combined with NAFLD, owing to cardiovascular and liver-specific mortality, including higher HCCrisk. From a therapeutic point of view, weight loss is regarded as the cornerstone for the disease prevention and treatment. Although diet and exercise are the first choice to this aim, they are both difficult to achieve and sustain. Thus, the need for pharmacological treatment is considered of high importance. To treat obesity through pharmacologic weight loss, orlistat has been investigated, though with limited efficacy. Currently, liraglutide appears to be more efficacious, but it has not been officially approved for specifically NASH patients. Bariatric surgery is another alternative for severely obese patients showing histological improvement in NASH patients. However, since relative data from randomized trials are very limited, morbid obesity-related NASH patients may be subjected to bariatric surgery only after a careful individualized risk-benefit assessment.},

Diet and exercise that result in a sustained body weight reduction of 7–10% can improve liver fat content, NASH, and fibrosis. Vitamin E can be considered in patients with biopsy-proven NASH without diabetes, though caution must be used in those with prostate cancer. Pioglitazone improves liver histology, including fibrosis, and can be considered in patients with or without diabetes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) antagonists may be beneficial in NASH, but more studies are needed before they can be recommended. Bariatric surgery, with resultant weight loss, can result in improvement in liver fat and inflammation. Summary: NAFLD treatment includes diet and exercise with a target 7–10% weight reduction.

@article{Jung2014,
abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates that obesity is closely associated with an increased risk of metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Obesity results from an imbalance between food intake and energy expenditure, which leads to an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is now recognized not only as a main site of storage of excess energy derived from food intake but also as an endocrine organ. The expansion of adipose tissue produces a number of bioactive substances, known as adipocytokines or adipokines, which trigger chronic low-grade inflammation and interact with a range of processes in many different organs. Although the precise mechanisms are still unclear, dysregulated production or secretion of these adipokines caused by excess adipose tissue and adipose tissue dysfunction can contribute to the development of obesity-related metabolic diseases. In this review, we focus on the role of several adipokines associated with obesity and the potential impact on obesity-related metabolic diseases. Multiple lines evidence provides valuable insights into the roles of adipokines in the development of obesity and its metabolic complications. Further research is still required to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the metabolic actions of a few newly identified adipokines. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

As a consequence, apart from increasing all-cause mortality, obesity seems to increase liver-specific mortality in NAFLD patients. Given the lack of approved pharmacological interventions for NAFLD, targeting obesity is a rational option for its management. As the first step, lifestyle modification (diet and exercise) is recommended, although it is difficult to achieve and sustain. When the first step fails, adding pharmacotherapy is recommended. Several anti-obesity medications have been investigated in NAFLD (e.g., orlistat, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs), other anti-obesity medications have not been investigated (e.g., lorcaserin, phentermine hydrochloric, phentermine/topiramate and naltrexone/bupropion), whereas some medications with weight-lowering efficacy have not been approved for obesity (e.g., sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, farnesoid X receptor ligands). If the combination of lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy also fails, then bariatric surgery should be considered in selected morbidly obese individuals.

Methods: By means of a comprehensive literature review where special attention was devoted to articles published in the last 5 years, NAFLD is discussed in view of new concepts, diagnosis, staging, and treatment. Results: NAFLD is emerging as one of the main causes of chronic liver disease and it is believed to be the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome, whose central features include obesity, hyperinsulinemia, peripheral insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The surgical treatment of morbid obesity is one of the options available for the treatment of NAFLD. Conclusion: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is strongly related with obesity.},

abstract = {About 90 per cent of morbidly obese patients show histological abnormalities of the liver. One third of patients have fatty change involving more than 50 per cent of hepatocytes. Fatty liver disease can be divided into four histological groups: Fatty liver, fatty hepatitis, fatty liver with portal fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Most patients show only fatty change. Alcohol, drugs, diabetes, poor nutrition, and weight-reducing surgery contribute to progressive liver damage, but morbid obesity alone may lead to severe disease showing all the features of alcoholic hepatitis and may end in cirrhosis and liver failure. The accumulation of fat alone is unlikely to be the stimulus to inflammation and fibrosis. Only one fifth of patients have complaints that arise from the liver. The development of severe fatty liver disease may also be asymptomatic and rarely shows the florid picture associated with alcoholic hepatitis. There is poor correlation of liver function test results with morphology in obesity. ALT levels exceeding twice the normal limit have some predictive value for histological grades of severity, but they are present in few patients. Pericentral and pericellular fibrosis in prebypass liver biopsies may be an important prognostic lesion for the development of fatty hepatitis and cirrhosis. In contrast with the frequent progression to massive fatty change, inflammation and fibrosis after bypass surgery, weight loss by low-calorie dieting, or starvation is accompanied by improvement in fatty change and return of liver function tests to normal.},

Since it is an illness that can progress to cirrhosis, it is necessary to establish an appropriate treatment. Until now, the more efficient therapeutic has been reached through the treatment of associate diseases, as obesity, dislipemia, diabetes and hypertension, although an adequate pharmacological treatment has not been found. The most useful medicaments, partially effective, have been insulin-sensitizing agent as thiazolidinediones.},

abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide, and a major cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is intimately linked with other metabolic disorders characterized by insulin resistance. Metabolic diseases are driven by chronic inflammatory processes, in which macrophages perform essential roles. The polarization status of macrophages is itself influenced by metabolic stimuli such as fatty acids, which in turn affect the progression of metabolic dysfunction at multiple disease stages and in various tissues. For instance, adipose tissue macrophages respond to obesity, adipocyte stress and dietary factors by a specific metabolic and inflammatory programme that stimulates disease progression locally and in the liver. Kupffer cells and monocyte-derived macrophages represent ontologically distinct hepatic macrophage populations that perform a range of metabolic functions. These macrophages integrate signals from the gut-liver axis (related to dysbiosis, reduced intestinal barrier integrity, endotoxemia), from overnutrition, from systemic low-grade inflammation and from the local environment of a steatotic liver. This makes them central players in the progression of NAFLD to steatohepatitis (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH) and fibrosis. Moreover, the particular involvement of Kupffer cells in lipid metabolism, as well as the inflammatory activation of hepatic macrophages, may pathogenically link NAFLD/NASH and cardiovascular disease. In this review, we highlight the polarization, classification and function of macrophage subsets and their interaction with metabolic cues in the pathophysiology of obesity and NAFLD. Evidence from animal and clinical studies suggests that macrophage targeting may improve the course of NAFLD and related metabolic disorders.},

abstract = {With the recent urbanization and globalization, the adult obesity rate has been increasing, which was paralleled with a dramatic surge in the incidence and prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD poses a growing threat to human health as it represents the most common cause of chronic liver disease in developed countries. It encompasses a wide spectrum of conditions starting from a build-up of fat in hepatocytes (steatosis), to developing inflammation (steatohepatitis), and reaching up to cirrhosis. It is also associated with higher rates of cardiovascular mortalities. Therefore, proper timely treatment is essential and weight loss remains the cornerstone in the treatment of obesity-related liver diseases. When diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes are not successful, the current recommendation for weight loss includes antiobesity medications and bariatric endoscopic and surgical interventions. These interventions have shown to result in significant weight loss and improve liver steatosis and fibrosis. In the current literature review, we highlight the expected outcomes and side effects of the currently existing options to have a weight-centric NAFLD approach.},

Patients with NAFLD are usually asymptomatic, but it is associated with a series of metabolic diseases and may even progress to fatal end-stage liver disease. Epidemiological evidence demonstrates that NAFLD is closely related to obesity and is more common among obese individuals than those with normal body weight. Besides, many studies explore the related molecular mechanism between NAFLD and obesity, which may involve insulin resistance, increased release of free fatty acid, changes in concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and adipocytokines.

abstract = {The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rising worldwide, paralleling the epidemic of obesity. The liver is a key organ for the metabolism of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Various types of fats and carbohydrates in isocaloric diets differently influence fat accumulation in the liver parenchyma. Therefore, nutrition can manage hepatic and cardiometabolic complications of NAFLD. Even moderately reduced caloric intake, which leads to a weight loss of 5%-10% of initial body weight, is effective in improving liver steatosis and surrogate markers of liver disease status. Among dietary patterns, the Mediterranean diet mostly prevents the onset of NAFLD. Furthermore, this diet is also the most recommended for the treatment of NAFLD patients. However, clinical trials based on the dietary interventions in NAFLD patients are sparse. Since there are only a few studies examining dietary interventions in clinically advanced stages of NAFLD, such as active and fibrotic steatohepatitis, the optimal diet for patients in these stages of the disease must still be determined. In this narrative review, we aimed to critically summarize the associations between different dietary patterns, obesity and prevention/risk for NAFLD, to describe specific dietary interventions' impacts on liver steatosis in adults with NAFLD and to provide an updated overview of dietary recommendations that clinicians potentially need to apply in their daily practice.},

abstract = {It has been hypothesized that visceral fat releases free fatty acids and adipokines and thereby exposes the liver to fat accumulation. The authors aimed to evaluate current epidemiologic evidence for an association between abdominal fat and liver fat content. Clinical and epidemiologic studies with data on abdominal fat and liver fat content were reviewed. Studies using waist circumference to estimate abdominal fat mass suggested a direct association between abdominal fat and liver fat content. Studies using imaging methods suggested a direct association between intraabdominal fat and liver fat content, but not between subcutaneous abdominal fat and liver fat content. In conclusion, clinical and epidemiologic studies of abdominal fat and liver fat content suggest a direct association between abdominal fat and liver fat content which is probably accounted for by visceral fat. However, results from the included studies do not allow strong conclusions regarding the temporal sequence of events. Future longitudinal studies are recommended to obtain additional information on associations and mechanisms. Both abdominal fat depots and other body compartments of interest should be included to further investigate the association between specific fat depots and liver fat content.

abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is recognized as the most common type of chronic liver disease in Western countries. Insulin resistance is a key factor in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the latter being considered as the hepatic component of insulin resistance or obesity. Adiponectin is the most abundant adipose-specific adipokine. There is evidence that adiponectin decreases hepatic and systematic insulin resistance, and attenuates liver inflammation and fibrosis. Adiponectin generally predicts steatosis grade and the severity of NAFLD; however, to what extent this is a direct effect or related to the presence of more severe insulin resistance or obesity remains to be addressed. Although there is no proven pharmacotherapy for the treatment of NAFLD, recent therapeutic strategies have focused on the indirect upregulation of adiponectin through the administration of various therapeutic agents and/ or lifestyle modifications. In this adiponectin-focused review, the pathogenetic role and the potential therapeutic benefits of adiponectin in NAFLD are analyzed systematically. {\textcopyright} 2013 Baishideng.

Excess intake of saturated fatty acids, increased free fatty acids derived from white adipose tissue lipolysis, reduced $\beta$-oxidation along with an increase in de novo lipogenesis and decreased synthesis or secretion of VLDL in hepatocytes contribute to the Hepatic steatosis. The treatment for these pathologies is initially based on diet changes and physical activity practice. In addition, there are still some classes of medicines available to treat the accumulation of fat in the liver as well as decrease insulin resistance.

abstract = {Obesity is associated with an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Steatosis, the hallmark feature of NAFLD, occurs when the rate of hepatic fatty acid uptake from plasma and de novo fatty acid synthesis is greater than the rate of fatty acid oxidation and export (as triglyceride within very low-density lipoprotein). Therefore, an excessive amount of intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) represents an imbalance between complex interactions of metabolic events. The presence of steatosis is associated with a constellation of adverse alterations in glucose, fatty acid, and lipoprotein metabolism. It is likely that abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism, in conjunction with adipose tissue, hepatic, and systemic inflammation, are key factors involved in the development of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and other cardiometabolic risk factors associated with NAFLD. However, it is not clear whether NAFLD causes metabolic dysfunction or whether metabolic dysfunction is responsible for IHTG accumulation, or possibly both. Understanding the precise factors involved in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of NAFLD will provide important insights into the mechanisms responsible for the cardiometabolic complications of obesity.

Its identification added to the fat tissues in the human body the role of a multifunctional organ that produces and secretes a number of bioactive peptides and proteins, called adipocytokines. Changes in the amount of fat tissue, such as the ones that occur in obesity, affect the production of most of these factors secreted by adipocytes. Even if these changes are frequently associated with many metabolic disorders and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, the role of fat tissue in the development of these complications, considered its endocrine function, continue to be investigated. The concentration of various adipocytokines increase in obesity and have been associated with hypertension (angiotensinogen), fibrinolysis impairment (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) and insulin resistance (protein that stimulates acylation, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukine-6 and resistin). On the other hand, leptin and adiponectin affect insulin sensitivity. In obesity, insulin resistance is also associated with leptin resistance and reduced plasma levels of adiponectin. Leptin and adiponectin still have complementary and distinct organic functions: adiponectin has potent antiatherogenic activity while leptin participates in the control of food intake. Some medications used to control diabetes increase adiponectin production in rodents and humans, suggesting that the development of new medications that target the adipocytokines can represent a new therapeutic alternative to prevent insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in obese individuals.},

abstract = {Background A lack of agreement on definitions and terminology used for nutrition-related concepts and procedures limits the development of clinical nutrition practice and research. Objective This initiative aimed to reach a consensus for terminology for core nutritional concepts and procedures. Methods The European Society of Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) appointed a consensus group of clinical scientists to perform a modified Delphi process that encompassed e-mail communication, face-to-face meetings, in-group ballots and an electronic ESPEN membership Delphi round. Results Five key areas related to clinical nutrition were identified: concepts; procedures; organisation; delivery; and products. One core concept of clinical nutrition is malnutrition/undernutrition, which includes disease-related malnutrition (DRM) with (eq. cachexia) and without inflammation, and malnutrition/undernutrition without disease, e.g. hunger-related malnutrition. Over-nutrition (overweight and obesity) is another core concept. Sarcopenia and frailty were agreed to be separate conditions often associated with malnutrition. Examples of nutritional procedures identified include screening for subjects at nutritional risk followed by a complete nutritional assessment. Hospital and care facility catering are the basic organizational forms for providing nutrition. Oral nutritional supplementation is the preferred way of nutrition therapy but if inadequate then other forms of medical nutrition therapy, i.e. enteral tube feeding and parenteral (intravenous) nutrition, becomes the major way of nutrient delivery. Conclusion An agreement of basic nutritional terminology to be used in clinical practice, research, and the ESPEN guideline developments has been established. This terminology consensus may help to support future global consensus efforts and updates of classification systems such as the International Classification of Disease (ICD). The continuous growth of knowledge in all areas addressed in this statement will provide the foundation for future revisions.},

abstract = {Objective: The present study is planned to investigate the antidiabetic and cardioprotective potential of Eclipta alba L. (EA) and Wedelia calendulacea L. (WC) in Type-II Diabetes. Methods: Type-II diabetes was induced by HFD and low dose of Streptozotocin (35 mg/kg i.p). Rats were divided into various two groups for antidiabetic activity 1) Normal control, 2) Positive control (HFD and Low dose of STZ, 35 mg/kg i.p). HFD was given for 12 weeks per oral, after 2 weeks of HFD, STZ was given i.p and the animals were kept as such without any drug treatment for 6 weeks. After 8 weeks rats exhibiting diabetes were given three different doses (once daily p.o) of the hydro-alcoholic extracts of the plants. After 4 weeks of continuous treatment, the animals were sacrificed to study various bio-chemical markers and strips of aorta excised for further study. Concentration response curve for relaxation by ONOO- and acetylcholine on aorta precontracted with Phenylephrine PE (10-5 M) were constructed in age matched normal control, disease control and treated (std. &test compound) rat thoracic aortas. Percent relaxation and pD2 values were measured for each group. The data was treated with appropriate statistical methods to know the significance of the results. Result: The plant extracts brought about positive improvements in the lipid profile, blood glucose, serum insulin and blood pressure in a dose dependant manner. Combination of extract of EA (500 mg/kg) and WC (500 mg/kg) with std. drugs showed significant synergistic effect. Present study showed decrease in SOD and catalase and increase in MDA levels in diabetic rats. Extract of both the plants showed significant increase in SOD and catalase and decrease in MDA levels. In diabetic rat aortic strips, ONOO- and Ach induced relaxation was impaired compared to normal rat thoracic aorta. Treatment with EA and WC showed the significant increase in ONOO- and Ach induced relaxation as compared to disease control rat thoracic aortas. Conclusion: The results of the present study point towards the beneficial effects of Eclipta alba and Wedelia calendulacea in conditions of diabetes and associated disorders.},

abstract = {Background Wedelolactone (WEL), a medicinal plant-derived coumestan, has been reported to exhibit a diverse range of pharmacological activities. However, the metabolism and disposition of WEL remain unexplored. Purpose The present study aims to investigate the metabolism of WEL in rats and identify the enzymes responsible for forming major WEL metabolites. Methods Plasma, urine, feces, and bile samples were collected before and after 50 mg/kg WEL was orally administered to rats. Metabolites were profiled by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-solid-phase extraction-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The in vitro WEL glucuronidation activities of human liver microsomes, human kidney microsomes, human intestine microsomes, and 12 recombinant human uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms were screened. Molecular docking simulation of the interaction between WEL and UGT1A9 was conducted. Results WEL underwent extensive metabolism, and 17 metabolites were identified. The major metabolic pathways observed were glucuronidation and methylation. Glucuronic acid was preferentially introduced into 5-OH, whereas no obvious regioselectivity was observed in the methylation of 11-OH and 12-OH. Multiple UGTs, including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10, were involved in forming WEL glucuronides and O-methylated WEL glucuronides. Conclusion The extensive glucuronidation and methylation is responsible for the low oral bioavailability of WEL in rats. UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 were the major enzymes involved in the glucuronidation of WEL and O-methylated WEL. Molecular docking studies revealed that 5-OH was accessible to the catalytic domain of UGT1As; therefore, 5-OH exhibited a high probability of glucuronidation.},

The green synthesized EA-AuNPs was characterized by spectrometric studies, such as UV–vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) study, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and by microscopic studies such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The synthesized EA-AuNPs showed surface plasmon resonance band at 536 nm and the particle was spherical about 26 nm with a good zeta potential value of −12mv. The anti-apoptotic potential of EA-AuNPs was proved by evaluating the NF-$\kappa$B mediated apoptotic pathway in STZ-induced diabetes in RIN-5F cell line. We further showed the free radical scavenging potential of EA-AuNPs and stabilized EA-AuNPs demonstrated strong antibacterial activity against human pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, we conclude that Eclipta alba has a good potential to synthesize AuNPs and the synthesized EA-AuNPs are promising for biomedical applications in the field of nanomedicine.},

abstract = {Echinocystic acid (EA) is a natural triterpone enriched in various herbs and has been used for medicinal purposes in China. In the present study, we systematically examined the effects of EA on ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats for the first time. Three-monthold female ovariectomy (OVX) Sprague-Dawley rats were used to evaluate the osteoprotective effect of EA. Results showed that administration of EA (5 or 15 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks prevented lower levels of maximum stress and Young's modulus of femur induced by OVX. EA also recovered bone metabolic biomarkers levels in OVX rats, including osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatese, deoxypyridinoline, and urinary calcium and phosphorus. EA (5 and 15 mg/kg/day) could prevent the alteration of total bone mineral density in the femur caused by OVX. However, only high dose (15 mg/kg/day) of EA significantly improved trabecular architecture, as evidenced by higher levels of bone volume/tissue volume, trabecula number, and trabecula thickness, and lower levels of trabecula separation and structure model index compared with OVX rats. In addition, EA treatment decresed the serum levels of IL-1$\beta$ and TNF-$\alpha$ in OVX rats. In conclusion, EA could prevent reduction of bone mass and strength and improve the cancellous bone structure and biochemical properties in OVX rats. Hence, EA may serve as a new candidate or a leading compound for antiosteoporosis. Copyright:},

Amway grows this herb in their Brazil farm, its harvest cycle is 75 - 90 days, aerials parts are used for processing and extraction. Eclipta Alba was one of the herb that was included in our internally developed discovery screening process. In the initial screening assay Eclipta showed PGC 1alpha stimulation function. We then performed confirmatory test to show that Eclipta indeed stimulates mitochondrial mass. Furthermore we have shown that a compound Wadelactone found in the plant can also activate PGC 1alpha. Geroscience research have identified mitochondrial dysfunction as key in the aging process and stimulating PGC 1alpha could be one mechanism to counter mitochondrial dysfunction and hence slow aging. This initial discovery process of stimulating PGC 1alpha activity identified Eclipta as a potential botanical ingredient for products in our antiaging category. We then developed an in house extraction method to produce Eclipta Alba extracts that could be used in a product as an antiaging ingredient.},

Obesity has a profound impact on quality of life, even in seemingly healthy individuals. Diet, physical activity or exercise and lifestyle changes are the cornerstones of obesity treatment, but medical treatment and bariatric surgery are becoming important. Family history, food environment, cultural preferences, adverse reactions to food, perinatal nutrition, previous or current diseases and physical activity patterns are relevant aspects for the health care professional to consider when treating the individual with obesity. Clinicians and other health care professionals are often ill-equipped to address the important environmental and socioeconomic drivers of the current obesity epidemic. Finally, understanding the epigenetic and genetic factors as well as metabolic pathways that take advantage of 'omics' technologies could play a very relevant part in combating obesity within a precision approach.},

A total of 3,653 residents randomly selleded from among the citizens of Suita City, Osaka, Japan were enlisted as subjects, in whom we investigated sweet preference, clinical characteristics, including obesity and serum leptin level, and the polymorphisms of LEP and LEPR (G-2548A and A19G for LEP; R109K, R223Q, and re3790439 for LEPR). We determined the associations among the parameters using logistic regression analysis, in order to consider potential confounding factors for sweet preference and/or obesity. The LEP A19G and LEPR R109K pollymorphisms were associated with sweet preference, whereas the serum leptin level was not. Further, the LEPR 109KK genotype was found to be associated with obesity along with sweet preference. In conclusion, our results are the first to show associations of LEP and LEPR polymorphisms with sweet preference, and may provide useful information for diagnosis and treatment of lifestyle-related diseases.},

SUBJECTS: In all, 15 nondiabetic obese women with a body mass index (BMI) above 32 kg/m2 were investigated. METHOD: Circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (MG), fibrinogen, alpha 1 antitrypsin and both circulating and adipose tissue levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)$\alpha$ and leptin were measured by either nephelometry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: We found a strong positive correlation between both circulating and adipose tissue levels of IL-6, TNF$\alpha$ and leptin and serum CRP levels. All these adipose tissue adipocytokines were also positively correlated with serum AAG levels. These correlations disappeared when adjusted for fat mass, suggesting that the relationship observed was dependent on fat amount. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a strong relationship between adipocytokines and inflammatory markers, and suggest that cytokines secreted by adipose tissue in obese subjects could play a role in increased inflammatory proteins secretion by the liver.},

Increased body mass index and obesity are strongly amalgamated with changes in the physiological function of adipose tissue, leading to altered secretion of adipocytokines, inflammatory mediators release as well as chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. The purposes of this study were to review the evidence of how obesity and inflammation may lead to insulin resistance and cancer. Recent findings suggested that increased level of inflammatory mediators in obesity, plays an introductory and cabalistic role in the development of different types of inflammatory disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus. Link between elevated body mass index and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several of the factors−such as increased levels of leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, decreased levels of adiponectin, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation etc. consequently result in carcinogenesis and carcinogenic progression too. Conclusion: This review summarizes how cytokine production in adipose tissue of obese subject creates a chronic inflammatory environment that favors tumor cell motility and invasion to enhance the metastatic potential of tumor cells. High levels of cytokine in the circulation of affected individuals have been associated with a significantly worse outcome. This article also reconnoiters the mechanisms that link obesity to numerous disorders such as inflammation, diabetes, cancers and most specifically combine these processes in a single image. Understanding these mechanisms may assist to understand the consequences of obesity.},

abstract = {Objective: Current evidence suggests that obesity is associated with alteration of sweet taste perception. The purpose of this study was to determine if nonsurgical cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based weight loss can cause a change in sweet taste perception. Methods: This case-control study consisted of 51 women aged 21-64 years. Twenty-seven with obesity or overweight were assigned to an obesity (OB) group (BMI: 29.8 ± 0.5 kg/m2) and 24 to a normal control (NC) group (BMI: 20.9 ± 0.3 kg/m2). The OB group underwent a 30-week weight loss intervention using CBT-based group therapy. The results of measurement of detection threshold, suprathreshold perceived intensity, preference, and palatability, elements of sweet taste perception, were compared before and after the intervention. Psychological variables and appetite-related hormonal levels were measured. Results: Twenty-three patients and 22 controls completed the study. The OB group showed a 14.6% weight loss after the intervention. At baseline, the OB group preferred significantly higher sucrose concentrations than did the NC group; however, this difference was no longer significant after intervention. In the OB group, persistent pleasure and reduced desire for other taste, measured by repeated exposure to sweetness, normalized after weight loss to levels comparable to those seen in the NC group. No significant difference in discriminative perception of the threshold concentration or the suprathreshold sensory value was found between the two groups before or after intervention. A significant correlation was found between the basal preferred sucrose concentration and the serum leptin level of the OB group after adjusting for confounding factors, such as BMI, depressive symptom score, and trait-anxiety scores. Conclusions: Weight loss induced by CBT-based nonsurgical intervention resulted in the normalization of the sucrose preference and palatability of women with obesity. Leptin activity may be associated with the altered sweet taste preference of people with obesity.},

abstract = {The hypothalamus has an abundant expression of sweet taste receptors that play a role in glucose sensing and energy homeostasis. Evidence suggests that liking “sweets” can be associated with weight gain, but the influence of sweet taste preference (STP) on hypothalamic regulation of appetite is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that STP is associated with increased hypothalamic activation in response to glucose (a potential marker of obesity risk), and that greater STP and glucose-linked hypothalamic activation would predict greater weight gain. Forty-six (24 female) adults age 18-35 years completed the study. Height and weight were measured at baseline and 6-12 months later in a subset of 38. STP was assessed via the Monell 2-series, forced-choice tracking procedure. Arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and ∼35 min after 75g glucose ingestion, and hypothalamic response to glucose was measured by calculating hypothalamic blood flow (BF) after minus before glucose ingestion. Linear regression was used to examine relationships between STP and the hypothalamic response to glucose and changes in BMI before and after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, mean cerebral BF, and baseline BMI. Baseline BMI was 27.61±5.13 kg/m2. STP scores ranged from 3% to 29.39% w/v. The hypothalamic response to glucose ranged from -14.64 to 15.63 ml/100g/min. Change in BMI ranged from -2.93 to 6.00 kg/m2. STP was positively associated with hypothalamic response to glucose (unadjusted: $\beta$=0.65, p<0.0001; adjusted: $\beta$=0.29, p=0.01). Greater hypothalamic response to glucose was positively associated with increases in BMI (unadjusted: $\beta$=0.07, p=0.04; adjusted: $\beta$=0.09, p=0.07). STP was positively associated with increases in BMI (unadjusted: $\beta$=0.09, p=0.0004; adjusted: $\beta$=0.09, p=0.0002). Our results suggest that heightened STP is associated with a greater hypothalamic response to glucose which may relate to greater susceptibility for weight gain.A.G. Yunker: None. J. Alves: None.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A 2018 American Heart Association science advisory indicated that, pending further research, artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) may be an appropriate initial replacement for sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) during transition to unsweetened beverages (USBs). METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly assigned 203 adults (121 males, 82 females; 91.6% retention), who habitually consumed SSBs, to 3 groups and delivered free SSBs, ASBs, or USBs to their homes for 12 months. Outcomes included serum triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (primary), body weight, and sweet taste preference (experimental assessment, 0%–18% sucrose solutions). Change in serum triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio was not different between groups. Although overall change in weight also was not different between groups, we found effect modification (P=0.006) by central adiposity. Among participants in the highest tertile of baseline trunk fat but not other tertiles, weight gain was greater (P=0.002) for the SSB (4.4±1.0 kg, estimate±SE) compared with ASB (0.5±0.9 kg) or USB (−0.2±0.9 kg) group. Both sweetness threshold (–1.0±0.2% m/v; P=0.005) and favorite concentration (–2.3±0.4% m/v; P<0.0001) decreased in the USB group; neither changed in the SSB group. In the ASB group, sweetness threshold did not change, and favorite concentration decreased (–1.1±0.5% m/v; P=0.02). Pairwise comparison between the ASB and USB groups indicated a difference in sweetness threshold (P=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Replacing SSBs with noncaloric beverages for 12 months did not affect serum triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. Among individuals with central adiposity, replacing SSBs with either ASBs or USBs lowered body weight. However, USBs may have the most favorable effect on sweet taste preference.

Sweet taste preference was assessed using a forced-choice, paired-comparison tracking method before and after a very-low-calorie diet (VLCD). Results: Twenty participants were included in the analysis: mean age was 53.1 (standard deviation [SD]: 11.4) years, and 14 were female. The mean body mass index was 41.4 (SD: 7.5) kg m−2. The median preferred sucrose concentration before VLCD was 0.45 M. Following VLCD, mean change in weight was −13.3 (SD: 6.6) kg, and percentage weight change was −11.3% (SD: 5.9%). Based on mixed models with and without adjustment for demographic factors, diabetes status and smoking history, preferred sucrose concentration at baseline did not predict change in longer-term body weight. The change of preferred sucrose concentration following 12 weeks of VLCD was not significant (P-value 0.95). Conclusions: Change in weight during and after VLCD was not associated with sweet taste preferences at baseline. After diet-induced weight loss, sweet taste preferences did not change.},

abstract = {Research suggests that individuals with high liking for sweets are at increased risk for binge eating, which has been minimally investigated in individuals with binge-eating disorder (BED). Forty-one adults (85% female, 83% white) with binge eating concerns completed a sweet taste test and measures of eating disorder behaviors and food cravings. A subset of participants with BED completed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; N = 21) and a 24-hour dietary recall (N = 26). Regression models were used to compare highest sweet preferers (HSP [N = 18]) to other sweet preferers (OSP [N = 23]) and were used to assess associations between sweet taste preference and outcome variables. Effect sizes ($\eta$p2) for differences between HSP and OSP ranged from small (≤ 0.01) to large (≥ 0.24); group differences were statistically nonsignificant except for 24-hour caloric intake ($\eta$p2 = 0.16, p = 0.04), protein intake ($\eta$p2 = 0.16, p = 0.04), and insulin sensitivity index ($\eta$p2 = 0.24, p = 0.04), which were higher in HSP, and postprandial insulin, which was smaller in HSP ($\eta$p2 = 0.27, p = 0.03). Continuous analyses replicated postprandial insulin response. Compared with OSP, HSP reported numerically higher binge-eating frequency ($\eta$p2 = 0.04), over-eating frequency ($\eta$p2 = 0.06), and carbohydrate intake ($\eta$p2 = 0.14), and they exhibited numerically smaller postprandial glucose AUC ($\eta$p2 = 0.16). Sweet taste preference may have implications for glucose regulation, binge-eating frequency, and nutrient intake in BED.},

abstract = {Various global public health agencies recommend minimizing exposure to sweet-Tasting foods or beverages. The underlying rationale is that reducing exposure to the perception of sweet tastes, without regard to the source of sweetness, may reduce preferences for sweetness, added sugar intake, caloric intake, and body weight. However, the veracity of this sequence of outcomes has yet to be documented, as revealed by findings from recent systematic reviews on the topic. Efforts to examine and document the effects of sweetness exposure are needed to support evidence-based recommendations. They require a generally agreed-upon methodology for measuring sweetness in foods, beverages, and the overall diet. Although well-established sensory evaluation techniques exist for individual foods in laboratory settings, they are expensive and time-consuming, and agreement on the optimal approach for measuring the sweetness of the total diet is lacking. If such a measure could be developed, it would permit researchers to combine data from different studies and populations and facilitate the design and conduct of new studies to address unresolved research questions about dietary sweetness. This narrative review includes an overview of available sensory techniques, their strengths and limitations, recent efforts to measure the sweetness of foods and diets across countries and cultures, and a proposed future direction for improving methods for measuring sweetness toward developing the data required to support evidence-based recommendations around dietary sweetness.},

abstract = {Background Depression and anxiety have been associated with a range of symptoms that often overlap. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale{\^{a}}€21 (DASS-21) is a single instrument to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. This study aimed to adapt and validate the DASS-21 for use in the Brazilian Portuguese language. Methods The DASS-21 has been adapted following the translation-back translation methodology from English to Portuguese. 242 subjects completed the following assessments: the DASS-21, the Beck Depression Index (BDI), Beck Anxiety Index (BAI) and the Inventory of Stress Symptoms of Lipp (ISSL). Results The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) result was.949, indicating that the adequacy of the model was high. Cronbach's alpha was.92 for the depression,.90 for the stress, and.86 for the anxiety, indicating a good internal consistency for each subscale. The correlations between DASS scale and BDI scale, BAI scale and ISSL inventory were strong. The factorial analysis and distribution of factors among the subscales indicated that the structure of three distinct factors is adequate. Limitations Older subjects over 65 years of age were not largely represented in this sample. A study specific to this elderly population should be conducted. Another limitation of the study was education level. The impact of low education in its applicability should be considered. Conclusions The findings support the validity of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the DASS-21 and add to the evidence of the DASS-21 quality and ability to assess emotional states separately, eliminating the use of different instruments to assess these states. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Summary--The psychometric properties of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) were evaluated in a normal sample of N = 717 who were also administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The DASS was shown to possess satisfactory psychometric properties, and the factor structure was substantiated both by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. In comparison to the BDI and BAI, the DASS scales showed greater separation in factor loadings. The DASS Anxiety scale correlated 0.81 with the BAI, and the DASS Depression scale correlated 0.74 with the BDI. Factor analyses suggested that the BDI differs from the DASS Depression scale primarily in that the BDI includes items such as weight loss, insomnia, somatic preoccupation and irritability, which fail to discriminate between depression and other affective states. The factor structure of the combined BDI and BAI items was virtually identical to that reported by Beck for a sample of diagnosed depressed and anxious patients, supporting the view that these clinical states are more severe expressions of the same states that may be discerned in normals. Implications of the results for the conceptualisation of depression, anxiety and tension/stress are considered, and the utility of the DASS scales in discriminating between these constructs is discussed},

abstract = {Standard clinical significance classifications are based on movement between the "dysfunctional" and "functional" distributions; however, this dichotomy ignores heterogeneity within the "dysfunctional" population. Based on the methodology described by Tingey, Lambert, Burlingame, and Hansen (1996), the present study sought to present a 3-distribution clinical significance model for the 21-item version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21; P. F. Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) using data from a normative sample (n = 2,914), an outpatient sample (n = 1,000), and an inpatient sample (n = 3,964). DASS-21 scores were collected at pre- and post-treatment for both clinical samples, and patients were classified into 1 of 5 categories based on whether they had made a reliable change and whether they had moved into a different functional range. Evidence supported the validity of the 3-distribution model for the DASS-21, since inpatients who were classified as making a clinically significant change showed lower symptom severity, higher perceived quality of life, and higher clinician-rated functioning than those who did not make a clinically significant change. Importantly, results suggest that the new category of recovering is an intermediate point between recovered and making no clinically significant change. Inpatients and outpatients have different treatment goals and therefore use of the concept of clinical significance needs to acknowledge differences in what constitutes a meaningful change. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is a higher reported prevalence of mental health disorders with obesity. This study aimed to evaluate symptoms of anxiety, depression and chronic stress in adults with class 3 obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 ), and assess the effect of a multidisciplinary weight management program over 12 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adults with class 3 obesity enrolled in a publicly funded multidisciplinary weight management program in Sydney between March2018 and January-2022. The Depression Anxiety and Stress Score 21 (DASS21) was completed at baseline. A subset of participants completed follow-up DASS21 at 12 months. RESULTS: The studied population (n = 178) had a mean age of 49.6 ± 13.0 years, mostly Caucasian ethnicity (68.5%) with female predominance (68.5%). At baseline, mean BMI was 51.7 ± 10.2 kg/m2 . Common metabolic complications included hypertension (51.9%), dyslipidaemia (44.2%), and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (38.8%), while 70% reported joint pain, 46.4% gastroesophageal reflux disease and 45.4% obstructive sleep apnoea. Based on the DASS21 scores, at baseline, 53.9% (n = 96) had moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression, while 39.3% (n = 70) had moderate to extremely severe symptoms of chronic stress. Moderate to extremely severe anxiety symptoms were reported in 51.1% (n = 91), with 30.3% (n = 54) experiencing extremely severe anxiety symptoms at baseline. DASS21 scores were not affected by baseline BMI or presence of T2DM. For the subset who had completed the DASS21 at 12 months (n = 49) there was mean total weight loss of 9.5% (134.3 ± 21.1 kg vs 127.0 ± 19.8, p < 0.001), regardless of the presence of T2DM. Most participants achieved at least 5% weight loss (57.1%) or 10% weight loss (20.4%). A negative correlation was found between weight loss and baseline DASS21 Stress score (r = 0.314, p = 0.028) and DASS21 total score (r = 0.286, p = 0.046). No statistically significant improvement in symptoms of depression, anxiety or stress was found. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a very high prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety and chronic stress in adults with class 3 obesity. More than 1 in 2 studied participants were experiencing moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, and almost 1 in 3 reported levels of anxiety in the extremely severe range. Although high baseline symptoms of depression, anxiety and chronic stress predicted less weight loss, significant weight loss was still achieved by most participants in a multidisciplinary weight management program.},

abstract = {Background: Depression, anxiety, and binge eating are common psychiatric symptoms among people with obesity. Although many studies seek to understand the mechanisms of association between these psychiatric symptoms, there is no still consensus about the longitudinal association. Methods: 155 patients (124 women) were recruited from a university-based bariatric center and evaluated over three waves (T0-T1-T2). In the last period the sample comprised 126 (104 women) participants. Trained clinicians assessed psychiatric symptoms by telephone interview using measurement scales. Partial Least Squares (PLS) was applied to investigate the path effects between anxiety, depression and binge eating symptoms over time. Results: The results of path coefficients ($\beta$) showed that the effect of anxiety on depression was constantly significant in all periods T0 ($\beta$ = 0.74), T1 ($\beta$ = 0.71), and T2 ($\beta$ = 0.67). Anxiety had an effect on binge eating in T0 ($\beta$ = 0.39) and T2 ($\beta$ = 0.26) but not in T1. Binge eating affected depressive symptoms only in T2 ($\beta$ = 0.22). Two carry-over-effects were significant binge eating in T0-T1 ($\beta$ = 0.41) and T1-T2 ($\beta$ = 0.19). Limitations: Telephone interviews, social isolation due to the pandemic and the social desirability may have contributed to collection and information biases. Conclusion: Anxiety has significant path effects on depression and binge eating. Binge eating was shown to be the most unstable symptom over time. The time factor seems to contribute to path effects between the psychiatric symptoms. The results draw attention to the fact that psychiatric symptoms must be evaluated and treated in association with each other, and investigated over time.},

abstract = {Anxiety is a common disorder among college students, especially those with obesity. Obesity contributes to metabolic disorders and disturbs the neural functions, further leading to anxiety. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to determine the association between obesity and anxiety among college students and identified the potential factors for obesity-associated anxiety. We evaluated the intervention effects of calorie restriction on anxiety. Self-reported questionnaires were distributed to 1381 college students from January to March in 2021. Anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Participants were classified into anxiety and non-anxiety groups according to their STAI scores. Chi-squared test and logistic regression were used to analyze the potential factors. We found that 383 college students exhibited anxiety, accounting for 30.1% among all included college students, which was higher than the global average. The association between anxiety and obesity was observed among college students (p = 0.009), especially in males (p = 0.007). We identified that pre-obesity (p = 0.012), unhealthy calorie intake (p = 0.001), dieting (p = 0.003) and high academic year (p = 0.006) as the risk factors for anxiety and found that the long sleep duration was a protective factor for anxiety (p < 0.001). We found that more obese students showed an improvement of anxiety than the underweight students after calorie restriction (p < 0.001). Collectively, our findings suggest that obesity-associated anxiety is prevalent among the college students and could be alleviated by moderate calorie restriction. It is necessary for students to receive anxiety management in their college life. Additionally, the proper calorie restriction should be promoted to help students protect against obesity and obesity-associated anxiety.},

The aim of our study was to determine the association between body mass index (BMI) and pain, tender point count (TPC), disease activity, anxiety and depression in patients with FMS. Methods: This was a descriptive study. A total of 124 female FMS patients between 18 and 55 years of age were enrolled. FMS patients were evaluated with visual analog scale (VAS), fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ), Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A) and Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D). Patients were divided into three groups according to BMI levels: normal weight, overweight and obese. Normal weight was defined as BMI 18.5-24.9, overweight as BMI 25.0-29.9 and obesity as BMI ≥ 30. We assessed the BMI status and its association with symptom severity in patients with FMS. Results: Significant differences were detected in VAS, TPC, FIQ and HAM-D among the groups (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the groups in HAM-A (p = 0.328). The highest scores were found in the obese group. Significant positive correlations were determined between BMI levels and VAS, TPC, FIQ and HAM-D (r = 0.277, p = 0.002; r = 0.384, p < 0.001; r = 0.292, p = 0.001; r = 0.357, p < 0.001). Discussion: Obese female FMS patients had higher levels of pain, TPC, disease activity and depression. BMI was significantly and positively correlated with clinical manifestations of FMS. Therefore, FMS treatment programs should include weight loss strategies.},

The reliability and the concurrent validity of the HAM-A and its subscales proved to be sufficient. Internal validity tested by latent structure analysis was insufficient. The major problems with the HAM-A are that (1) anxiolytic and antidepressant effects cannot be clearly distinguished; (2) the subscale of somatic anxiety is strongly related to somatic side effects. The applicability of the HAM-A in anxiolytic treatment studies is therefore limited. More specific anxiety scales are needed. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {Background: Body image is a multidimensional construct and refers to a Person's Perception and attitudes, including feeling, thoughts and behaviours regarding their own body and appearance. The link between weight status and body image is complex, that body image might be affected by overweight through psychological distress, which has an impact on quality of life. Body image is an essential aspect of young girl's self-definition and individual identity which is influenced by various biological, psychological and social factors. Excessive concern about body image, body image misconception are leading to dissatisfaction, disturbed eating patterns, affecting the nutritional status and also leading to depression and anxiety disorders. This research study therefore sought to assess the level of anxiety among overweight and obese young girls with body image disturbance. Material and Methods: A quantitative descriptive study was conducted to assess the level of anxiety related to body image disturbance among study participants. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used to assess the baseline data. Total of 248 young girls were screened for body mass index and among that 50 overweight and obese girls with body image disturbance (using body image disturbance scale) were selected using convenient sampling technique and also the anxiety level of the girls with body image disturbance were measured using Hamilton anxiety scale. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants. Result: The study unveiled that among 248 young girls 12 were obese, 38 were overweight and 198 girls were in normal weight and underweight. Hence it showed that every 1 in 5 young girls are overweight and obese. The study also revealed that 4(8%) of young girls had mild body image disturbance, 27(54%) of them had moderate body image disturbance and 19(38%) of them had severe body image disturbance. It also showed that 18(36%) had mild anxiety,15(30%) had moderate anxiety,17(34%) had severe anxiety. The mean score of body image disturbance was 22.06+8.50 and the mean score of anxiety was 21.08 +12.22. The calculated Karl Pearson's correlation value of r=0.590 shows a moderate positive correlation which was found statistically significant at P < 0.001 level. It also revealed that only education of demographic variable (p=0.038) had shown significant association with level of anxiety. Conclusion: The study revealed that every 1 in 5 young girls had higher BMI more than 25kg/m2 and all the girls with higher BMI had body image disturbance and it also shows that all the girls with higher BMI had anxiety towards their body image. It also shows the moderate positive correlation between body image disturbance and the level of anxiety. This clearly infers that when body image disturbance increases then the anxiety level of the young girls also increases. This need to increase awareness and importance of healthy dietary pattern and regular physical activity to improve the physical appearance, self-esteem, perception and satisfaction among young girls.},

abstract = {Context Obesity is considered to have a detrimental impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Objective To compare HRQoL in a well-defined group of people with obesity with a population-based control group from the general public. Design Observational cross-sectional cohort study with a reference population. Setting The Regional Obesity Center at the Department of Medicine at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Participants People with obesity (n = 1122) eligible for surgical and non-surgical obesity treatment in routine care were included consecutively between 2015 and 2017 into the BASUN study. Men and women from the WHO-MONICA-GOT project were used as a reference population (n = 414). Main outcome measures HRQoL was measured with the RAND-36/Short Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36) and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for self-related health (SRH). Prescription drugs for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, depression, and anxiety were taken as a proxy for these conditions. Results People with obesity rated their overall HRQoL lower than the reference population according to the SRH-VAS. Lower scores were reported on physical and social functioning, vitality, general and mental health after adjustment for age and use of prescription drugs (considered a proxy for burden of disease, or comorbidities) using the RAND-36/SF-36 questionnaire. Use of some psychopharmacological agents was more common in patients with obesity. Conclusion People with obesity seeking help with weight reduction are more likely to have lower physical and mental self-reported HRQoL than the general population.},

abstract = {Background: Little is known about the burden that overweight and obesity impose on Dutch society. The aim of this study is to examine this burden in terms of cost-of-illness and health-related quality of life. Method: A bottom-up, prevalence-based burden of disease study from a societal perspective was performed. Cost-of-illness information including healthcare costs, patient and family costs, and other costs was obtained via the Treatment Inventory of Costs in Patients with psychiatric disorders (TiC-P) questionnaire. Health-related quality of life was assessed through the EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) and the BODY-Q instruments. Non-parametric bootstrapping was applied to test for significant differences in costs. Subgroup analyses were performed on all outcomes. Results: A total of 97 people with overweight and obesity completed the survey. Per respondent, mean healthcare costs were €2907, patient and family costs were €4037, and other costs were €4519, leading to a total societal cost of €11,463 per respondent per year. Total costs were significantly higher for respondents with obesity versus overweight and between low & intermediate versus highly educated respondents. The mean utility score of our population was 0.81. A significantly lower utility score was found for respondents with obesity in comparison with respondents with overweight. BODY-Q results show that respondents with obesity scored a significantly lower Rasch-score than did respondents with overweight in three scales. Respondents with a high education level and having paid work scored significantly higher Rasch-scores in two scales than did those with a low education level and without having paid work. The age group 19–29 have significantly higher Rasch-scores in three scales than respondents in the other two age categories. Conclusions: Overweight and obesity have a considerable impact on the societal costs and on health-related quality of life. The results show that the impact of overweight and obesity go beyond the healthcare sector, as the other costs have the biggest share of the total costs. Another interesting finding of this study is that obesity leads to significant higher costs and lower health-related quality of life than overweight. These findings draw attention to policy making, as collective prevention and effective treatment are needed to reduce this burden.},

abstract = {Stigmatization of people with obesity has been documented across the globe. Known as weight stigma, both adults and youth with obesity com- monly face mistreatment because of their body weight or size. There is substantial evidence of the harmful health consequences of weight stigma. Consistent links have been demonstrated between weight stigma and psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, poor body image, and substance use. Adverse effects of weight stigma on mental health can be long lasting, especially when stigma comes from family members and peers. Additionally, weight stigma contributes to a higher prevalence and frequency of unhealthy eating behaviors, such as binge eating, increased food consumption, and maladaptive weight control behaviors. A growing body of evidence further suggests that weight stigma predicts weight gain and obesity over time, implicating weight stigma as a psychosocial contributor to obesity. Links between weight stigma and impaired mental health and eating behaviors can be partially explained by the ways in which individuals respond to weight stigma in their lives; some individuals internalize negative weight-based stereotypes and devalue themselves because of their weight, referred to as weight bias internalization (WBI). WBI has emerged as a robust correlate of impaired mental health, unhealthy eating behaviors, and an obstacle in weight management. Furthermore, maladaptive coping responses to weight stigma may perpetuate adverse health behaviors. Evidence indi- cates positive associations between weight stigma and responses of engag- ing in increased food consumption and disordered eating behaviors as ways to cope with stigma-induced distress, including longitudinal asso- ciations between weight teasing in adolescence and using food to cope with stress in adulthood. Our recent multinational research highlights these concerning links between weight stigma, psychological distress, and adverse eating behaviors among people engaged in weight management across six Westernized countries. Moreover, our studies show that weight stigma exacerbates emotional distress and disordered eating during the pandemic, and extends to adults with type 2 diabetes. Collectively, this evidence has important implications for clinical care and public health, and underscores the need to identify effective approaches to support people with obesity and to reduce the harmful impact of stigma on their health and wellbeing.},

abstract = {Objectives: It has been suggested that obesity phenotypes are related to mental health problems and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, there is no certain consensus. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the association between different obesity phenotypes with common psychiatric symptoms and HRQoL. Methods: Electronic databases i.e. PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and google scholar were searched until September 2021, to identify studies that investigated associations between the obesity phenotypes with psychiatric symptoms and/or mental and physical HRQoL. Two researchers independently checked titles and abstracts, evaluated full-text studies, extracted data, and appraised their quality using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Results: Eighteen studies, with a total of 3,929,203 participants, were included. Of the studies included in this systematic review, 10 articles evaluated the association between obesity phenotypes and psychiatric symptoms, while six papers investigated the association between HRQoL and obesity phenotypes, and two studies assessed both. As a whole, the findings of these studies suggest that obese individuals with a favorable metabolic profile have a slightly higher risk of mental health problems and poor quality of life, however, the risk becomes larger when obesity is combined with an adverse metabolic profile. So, metabolically healthy obesity may not be a completely benign condition in relation to mental disorders and poor quality of life. Conclusion: According to published research, obesity is likely to increase the risk of mental health problems and poor quality of life when metabolic disturbances are present.},

The BES is a self-reported instrument developed to identify binge eaters within the obese population. The scale, at the cutoff point of 17, was compared with the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV-Patient version (SCID-I/P). It was administered to 178 obese Brazilian women, aged 18 to 60 years, seeking treatment for obesity at an outpatient clinic. To assess the test-retest reliability, 121 individuals filled the instrument again 15 days later. The Portuguese version of BES showed a sensitivity of 97.8%, a specificity of 47.7%, a positive predictive value of 66.7% and a negative predictive value of 95.3%. The test-retest reliability, measured by kappa statistics, was 0.66. Cronbach's alpha was 0.89. These results suggest that the BES is valid as a screening instrument for BED in obese Brazilian women seeking treatment for obesity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A 16-item Binge Eating Scale was constructed describing both behavioral manifestations (e.g., eating large amounts of food) and feelings/cognitions surrounding a binge episode (e.g., guilt, fear of being unable to stop eating). An 11-item Cognitive Factors Scale was developed to measure two cognitive phenomena thought to be related to binge eating: the tendency to set unrealistic standards for a diet (e.g., eliminating "favorite foods") and low efficacy expectations for sustaining a diet. The results showed that the Binge Eating Scale successfully discriminated among persons judged by trained interviewers to have either no, moderate or severe binge eating problems. Significant correlations between the scales were obtained such that severe bingers tended to set up diets which were unrealistically strict while reporting low efficacy expectations to sustain a diet. The discussion highlighted the differences among obese persons on binge eating severity and emphasized the role of cognitions in the relapse of self control of eating. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {Purpose of review ICU survivors frequently suffer significant, prolonged physical disability. 'ICU Survivorship', or addressing quality-of-life impairments post-ICU care, is a defining challenge, and existing standards of care fail to successfully address these disabilities. We suggest addressing persistent catabolism by treatment with testosterone analogues combined with structured exercise is a promising novel intervention to improve 'ICU Survivorship'. Recent findings One explanation for lack of success in addressing post-ICU physical disability is most ICU patients exhibit severe testosterone deficiencies early in ICU that drives persistent catabolism despite rehabilitation efforts. Oxandrolone is an FDA-approved testosterone analogue for treating muscle weakness in ICU patients. A growing number of trials with this agent combined with structured exercise show clinical benefit, including improved physical function and safety in burns and other catabolic states. However, no trials of oxandrolone/testosterone and exercise in nonburn ICU populations have been conducted. Summary Critical illness leads to a catabolic state, including severe testosterone deficiency that persists throughout hospital stay, and results in persistent muscle weakness and physical dysfunction. The combination of an anabolic agent with adequate nutrition and structured exercise is likely essential to optimize muscle mass/strength and physical function in ICU survivors. Further research in ICU populations is needed.},

abstract = {Obesity is a chronic disease associated with impaired physical and mental health. A widespread view in the treatment of obesity is that the goal is to normalize the individual's body mass index (BMI). However, a modest weight loss (usually above 5%) is already associated with clinical improvement, while weight losses of 10%-15% bring even further benefits, independent from the final BMI. The percentage of weight reduction is accepted as a treatment goal since a greater decrease in weight is frequently difficult to achieve due to metabolic adaptation along with environmental and lifestyle factors. In this document, the Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism (SBEM) and the Brazilian Society for the Study of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (ABESO) propose a new obesity classification based on the maximum weight attained in life (MWAL). In this classification, individuals losing a specific proportion of weight are classified as having "reduced" or "controlled" obesity. This simple classification - which is not intended to replace others but to serve as an adjuvant tool - could help disseminate the concept of clinical benefits derived from modest weight loss, allowing individuals with obesity and their health care professionals to focus on strategies for weight maintenance instead of further weight reduction. In future studies, this proposed classification can also be an important tool to evaluate possible differences in therapeutic outcomes between individuals with similar BMIs but different weight trajectories.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Some weight loss and exercise programs that have been successful in academic center-based trials have not been evaluated in community settings. OBJECTIVE To determine whether adaptation of a diet and exercise intervention to community settings resulted in a statistically significant reduction in pain, compared with an attention control group, at 18-month follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted in community settings in urban and rural counties in North Carolina. Patients were men and women aged 50 years or older with knee osteoarthritis and overweight or obesity (body mass index ≥27). Enrollment (N = 823) occurred between May 2016 and August 2019, with follow-up ending in April 2021. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to either a diet and exercise intervention (n = 414) or an attention control (n = 409) group for 18 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee pain score (range, 0 [none] to 20 [severe]; minimum clinically important difference, 1.6) over 18 months, tested using a repeated-measures mixed linear model with adjustments for covariates. There were 7 secondary outcomes including body weight. RESULTS Among the 823 randomized patients (mean age, 64.6 years; 637 [77%] women), 658 (80%) completed the trial. At 18-month follow-up, the adjusted mean WOMAC pain score was 5.0 in the diet and exercise group (n = 329) compared with 5.5 in the attention control group (n = 316) (adjusted difference, -0.6; 95% CI, -1.0 to -0.1; P = .02). Of 7 secondary outcomes, 5 were significantly better in the intervention group compared with control. The mean change in unadjusted 18-month body weight for patients with available data was -7.7 kg (8%) in the diet and exercise group (n = 289) and -1.7 kg (2%) in the attention control group (n = 273) (mean difference, -6.0 kg; 95% CI, -7.3 kg to -4.7 kg). There were 169 serious adverse events; none were definitely related to the study. There were 729 adverse events; 32 (4%) were definitely related to the study, including 10 body injuries (9 in diet and exercise; 1 in attention control), 7 muscle strains (6 in diet and exercise; 1 in attention control), and 6 trip/fall events (all 6 in diet and exercise). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with knee osteoarthritis and overweight or obesity, diet and exercise compared with an attention control led to a statistically significant but small difference in knee pain over 18 months. The magnitude of the difference in pain between groups is of uncertain clinical importance. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02577549.},

The difference is that while SIRS is a proinflammatory response tasked with killing infectious organisms through activation of the immune system, CARS is a global deactivation of the immune system tasked with restoring homeostasis. Much research now suggests that the timing and relative magnitude of this response have a profound impact on patient outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptor-35 (GPR35) has been shown to be a target of the asthma drugs cromolyn disodium and nedocromil sodium. Gallic acid and caffeic acids are reported to modulate allergic reactions via unknown mode(s) of action. Here we attempt to elucidate whether both phenolic acids share a common mode of action with the two asthma drugs. Label-free dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) assays showed that both phenolic acids triggered robust DMR signals in HT-29 cells, whose characteristics were similar to that of cromolyn disodium. Both phenolic acids resulted in detectable $\beta$-arrestin translocation signals in an engineered U2OS cell line stably expressing a C-terminal-modified GPR35, but with lower efficacy than cromolyn disodium. Antiallergic wedelolactone was found to be a potent $\beta$-arrestin-biased GPR35 agonist. These results suggest that certain anti-inflammatory phytochemicals including gallic acid and wedelolactone may modulate inflammatory allergic action via their agonism at GPR35. GPR35 may represent a target for the treatment of allergic disorders including asthma. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract = {The prevalence of obesity has increased alarmingly both worldwide and in Korea. This has also dramatically increased the prevalence of chronic obesity-associated diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). Extensive studies on the molecular etiology of T2D have revealed several potential mechanisms by which obesity induces the development of insulin resistance and T2D. One of these is low-grade chronic inflammation. Studies hinting at the existence of this phenomenon were first published about 30 years ago. Ten years later, several seminal papers confirmed its existence, which then led to a rapid and massive escalation of research in this field. Today, the notion that obesity-induced inflammation mediates T2D is now well-accepted. This paper will review the key developments in this field, including the discovery that obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance is mainly regulated by adipose tissue-resident immune cells, particularly those in visceral adipose tissue. This review further details the research areas, including (1) the obesity-related factors that induce adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) inflammation, (2) the precise effector functions by which adipose tissue immune cells promote insulin resistance, (3) whether there are early immunological events that have an outsize effect on later events and could be targeted to arrest the development of insulin resistance, (4) the roles played by nonimmunological functions of ATMs and other immune cells, and (5) whether there are noncanonical immune responses to obesity (i.e., immune responses that are unique to obesity and cannot be detected by following the discoveries in the classical immunity field).},

abstract = {Overweight and obesity are key risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Obesity is currently presented as a pro-inflammatory state with an expansion in the outflow of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$), alongside the expanded emission of leptin. The present review aimed to evaluate the relationship between obesity and inflammation and their impacts on the development of cardiovascular disease. A literature search was conducted by employing three academic databases, namely PubMed (Medline), Scopus (EMBASE), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). The search presented 786 items, and by inclusion and exclusion filterers, 59 works were considered for final review. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) method was adopted to conduct quality assessment; 19 papers were further selected based on the quality score. Obesity-related inflammation leads to a low-grade inflammatory state in organisms by upregulating pro-inflammatory markers and downregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines, thereby contributing to cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. Because of inflammatory and infectious symptoms, adipocytes appear to instigate articulation and discharge a few intense stage reactants and carriers of inflammation. Obesity and inflammatory markers are strongly associated, and are important factors in the development of CVD. Hence, weight management can help prevent cardiovascular risks and poor outcomes by inhibiting inflammatory mechanisms.},

In fact, emerging experimental evidence shows that abnormal modulation of T-cells in an obese state correlates with the development and progression of insulin resistance. Importantly, the evolving concept linking insulin resistance with impaired immunological mechanisms such as T-cell responses provides new prospects for understanding the role of inflammation in moderating metabolic complications.},

abstract = {Chronic inflammation of the adipose tissue (AT) is a critical component of obesity-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Adipose tissue immune cells, including AT macrophages (ATMs), AT dendritic cells (ATDCs), and T cells, are dynamically regulated by obesity and participate in obesity-induced inflammation. Among AT resident immune cells, ATDCs are master immune regulators and engage in crosstalk with various immune cells to initiate and regulate immune responses. However, due to confounding markers and lack of animal models, their exact role and contribution to the initiation and maintenance of AT inflammation and insulin resistance have not been clearly elucidated. This paper reviews the current understanding of ATDCs and their role in obesity-induced AT inflammation. We also provide the potential mechanisms by which ATDCs regulate AT inflammation and insulin resistance in obesity. Finally, this review offers perspectives on ways to better dissect the distinct functions and contributions of ATDCs to obesity.},

abstract = {Background: Both skeletal muscle mass and muscle quality are important predictors of poor prognosis in older patients. However, the effects of muscle mass and muscle quality estimated by the phase angle (PhA) on functional outcomes in older patients undergoing rehabilitation have yet to be reported. This study aimed to investigate whether appendicular skeletal muscle index (SMI) and muscle quality estimated by PhA were independently associated with activities of daily living (ADL) and physical function in older patients undergoing rehabilitation. Methods: This prospective cohort study included older patients in a subacute rehabilitation hospital (n = 443). Baseline SMI and PhA were measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis, and low SMI or low PhA were determined using each cutoff value. The primary outcomes were ADL abilities measured using the functional independence measure for motor function (FIM-M) score and physical function measured using the short physical performance battery (SPPB) score at hospital discharge. Association between low SMI and low PhA and FIM-M or SPPB scores at discharge were determined using multiple regression analysis adjusted for confounding factors. Results: There were significant differences between the normal- and low-PhA groups in the FIM-M and SPPB scores at discharge (P < 0.001). In multiple regression analysis, low PhA was independently associated with FIM-M ($\beta$ = −0.109, P = 0.013) and SPPB scores ($\beta$ = 0.535, P < 0.001) at discharge; however, low SMI was not independently associated with these functional outcomes. Conclusion: Decreased muscle quality estimated by the PhA was independently associated with poor ADL abilities and poor physical function in older patients undergoing rehabilitation.},

Among the isolated compounds, orobol (5) exhibited the highest activity against NO release with an IC 50 value of 4.6$\mu$m, followed by compounds 1, 2 and 4 with IC 50 values of 12.7, 14.9 and 19.1$\mu$m, respectively. The IC 50 value of compound 5 against PGE 2 release was found to be 49.6$\mu$m, whereas it was inactive towards TNF-$\alpha$ (IC 50>100$\mu$m). The mechanism of orobol (5) was found to down-regulate iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent manner.

However, the relative importance of these characteristics has not been investigated in a population with binge eating disorder (BED), who by definition all have objectively large binge episodes. Persons with BED and higher weight (N = 34) were enrolled in a BED treatment trial and completed the Loss of Control Over Eating Scale, the Eating Disorder Examination, and measures of eating behavior, mood, and quality of life. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight. The size of the largest binge episode (measured in kilocalories) and degree of LOC were entered into multiple regression equations to determine their relationships with disordered eating symptoms, depression, quality of life, and BMI in this pilot study. Greater LOC had a stronger independent association than binge size with higher total eating psychopathology, shape dissatisfaction, hunger, food cravings and food addiction symptoms. Larger binge size had a stronger independent association than LOC with higher weight concern and lower general and social quality of life. Both characteristics were associated with higher eating concern and neither were associated with depression or BMI. Both binge size and degree of LOC are associated with important psychosocial treatment targets in patients with BED. Future research should validate the largest binge episode measurement method and replicate the present findings in a larger sample.},

abstract = {Purpose of Review: The purposes of this study were to examine the relationships between obesity and a wide range of mental health issues and to identify where sex differences exist and may vary across disorders. Recent Findings: Research on sex differences in the relationship between obesity and psychiatric disorders is more abundant in some areas, such as depression and eating disorders, than others, such as anxiety, trauma, and substance use. However, for most of the disorders, their relationships with obesity and sex are complex and are usually moderated by additional variables. Thus, studies that find stronger relationships for women between depression and obesity cross-sectionally do not tell the whole story, as longitudinal studies suggest that this relationship may also be present among men, particularly when confounders are considered. For those with eating disorders, men and women with obesity are fairly equally affected, and weight and shape concerns may play a role in maintaining these behaviors for both sexes. Weight stigma, though, seems to have worse consequences for women than men with obesity. Summary: Sex differences exist in relation to the associations between mental health and obesity. However, these differences vary by disorder, with disorder-specific moderators playing a role, such as age for depressive disorders, comorbid depression for anxiety disorders, and weight and shape concerns for eating disorders. More work is needed to understand if sex differences play a role in the relationship between obesity and anxiety, trauma, and substance use disorders.},

It involved a population-based cohort of 689 adults aged 40 to 64 years followed up for four years. The proportion of reduction and increase in BMI (≥1 kg/m²) was verified according to sociodemographic variables and classification of nutritional status in the baseline by means of crude and adjusted Poisson regression. There was a higher incidence of reduced BMI among men in the 55-64 age group (RR: 1.78; 95%CI: 1.06-3.00), in those without a partner (RR: 1.85; 95%CI: 1.09-3.14), in those classified as overweight (RR: 2.06; 95%CI: 1.13- 3.74) and in those classified as obese (RR: 2.33; 95%CI: 1.24-4.35), and among women in the 55- 64 age group (RR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.02-2.00) and in those classified as obese (RR: 2.10; 95%CI%: 1.30-3.38). The incidence of increased BMI was lower in the 55 to 64 age group among men (RR: 0.62; 95%CI: 0.41-0.95) and women (RR: 0.68; 95%CI: 0.49-0.95).

Though the exact cause of AD is unknown, there are evidence that people with AD have a compromised skin barrier along with inflammation. Eclipta prostrata Linn{\'{e}} is a traditional herbal medicinal plant, has been used for the diabetes, obesity, jaundice, and inflammation. We supposed E. prostrata L. has an anti-inflammatory effect on the skin. Aim of the study: We aimed to assess the effect of E. prostrata L. EtOH extract (EP) and elucidate the associated molecular mechanisms. Materials and methods: The effect of EP and the molecular mechanisms were eluciated in house dust mite (HDM)-induced AD mice model and TNF-$\alpha$/IFN-$\gamma$-stimulated HaCaT keratinocytes by histological analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot. Results: The results revealed that EP improved the progression of AD symptoms, decreasing epidermis/dermis thickness, infiltrated immune cells, and restored the skin barrier dysfunction and imbalanced immune response. EP suppressed the expressions of T helper (Th)1, Th2, Th17 cytokines, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in skin of HDM-induced AD mice as well as inhibition the translocation of nuclear factor-$\kappa$B in HaCaT keratinocytes. Conclusions: Collectively, EP improved the allergic inflammation of the skin through recovery the skin barrier, and regulation the immune balance. These results suggest EP may have therapeutic potential as an anti-atopic agent.},

Neonatal exposure to the carcinogenic N-N′ethylnitrosourea (ENU), a NOC has been established to cause leukemogenesis. Our world is constantly battling against cancer with consistent investigations of new anti-cancer therapeutics. Plant derived compounds have grasped worldwide attention of researchers for their promising anti-cancer potentials. Eclipta prostrata is one such ayurvedic herb, renowned for its anti-inflammatory properties. Currently, it has been explored in various cancer cell lines to establish its anti-cancer effect, but rarely in in-vivo cancer models. Wedelolactone (WDL), the major coumestan of E. prostrata is recognized as an inhibitor of IKK, a master regulator of the NF-kB inflammatory pathway. As persistent inflammation and activated inflammasome contribute to leukemogenesis, we tried to observe anti-leukemogenic efficacy of E. prostrata and its active compound WDL on the marrow cells of ENU induced experimental leukemic mice. Treatment groups were administered an oral gavage at a dose of 1200 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg b.w of crude extract and WDL respectively for 4 weeks. Various parameters like hemogram, survivability, cytological and histological investigations, migration assay, cell culture, flowcytometry and confocal microscopy were taken into consideration pre- and post-treatment. Interestingly, the plant concoction portrayed maximum effects in comparison to WDL alone. The study suggests E. prostrata and WDL as vital complementary adjuncts for anti-inflammasome mechanism in ENU-induced leukemia.},

abstract = {Antioxidant therapy is an exciting new concept in the prevention and treatment of countless human diseases such as inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer and aging related disorders which originate from free radical derived oxidative stress. In the present investigation, methanolic and hydrolyzed extracts of Eclipta Alba Linn. were investigated for its antioxidant potential using in vitro and ex vivo models. Extraction of the powdered drug of Eclipta alba was carried out to obtain methanolic and hydrolyzed extracts. The in vitro antioxidant activity of plant extract were assessed on the basis of the radical scavenging effect of the stable DPPH free radical and Nitric oxide radical inhibition activity while ex vivo antioxidant activity was assessed by lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity on mice liver homogenate by TBARS method. In vitro and ex vivo models, demonstrates both methanolic and hydrolyzed extracts of Eclipta alba to be powerful scavengers of free radicals and nitric oxide radicals, as well as efficient inhibitors of lipid peroxidation. The methanolic extract of Eclipta alba revealed significant antioxidant activity and was much more effective than its isolated constituents (Hydrolyzed extract) as revealed by the IC50 values and statistical analysis. In conclusion, the data provided from in vitro and ex vivo studies indicate that the Eclipta alba plant is a potential source of natural antioxidants, thus could be taken as a platform for further formulating a suitable dosage form which will pave way for economic treatment in various diseases.},

Methods: The four fractions, i.e., n-butanol, ethyl acetate, chloroform, and n-hexane from hydro-alcoholic extract were obtained. First, the fractions were evaluated through in vitro models, and then they were evaluated by in vivo anti-inflammatory model, i.e., carrageenan-induced paw edema model. Further, two active fractions were evaluated for the anti-arthritic activity using formaldehyde induced arthritis model. Results: The fractions at a dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg showed an anti-inflammatory activity, but the ethyl acetate and chloroform fraction will show maximum anti-inflammatory potential. Hence, they are further evaluated for anti-arthritic potential where they show significant activity. Conclusion: From the results, it is concluded that the ethyl acetate and chloroform fraction show significant anti-arthritic activity.},

abstract = {Background and Aim: Ultrasound (US) is recommended for hepatic steatosis screening. The purpose of this study was to determine the usefulness of US hepatic-renal echo-intensity (HR) difference in the quantitative assessment of hepatic steatosis. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing liver biopsy were prospectively enrolled. Using US histogram technique, the mean gray level of hepatic parenchyma and right renal parenchyma at selected regions of interest were evaluated on the same day of biopsy. With steatosis assessed by histology as the reference, the diagnostic performances of HR difference in predicting the degree of steatosis was analyzed. The optimal cut-off level, diagnostic validity and post-test probability were assessed. Results: A total of 175 patients were enrolled (M/F, 103/72; mean age, 48.6 ± 11.7). There were 64 (36.5 %), 42 (24 %), 29 (16.6 %), 12 (6.9 %) and 28 (16 %) patients with steatosis of <5, 5-9, 10-19, 20-29 and ≥30 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed HR difference correlated with the severity of steatosis (R 2 = 0.425, p < 0.001) with positive correlation between HR difference and the severity of steatosis (r = 0.60, p < 0.001). The diagnostic performances were 0.927, 0.890, 0.816 and 0.760 for steatosis ≥30, ≥20, ≥10 and ≥5 %, respectively. The cut-off is 7 for diagnosing steatosis ≥30 %, with a negative predictive value of 97.6 %. The cut-off is 4 in predicting steatosis ≥5 %, with a positive predictive value of 79 %. The prevalence of steatosis influenced the post-test probability. Conclusions: Quantitative assessment of HR difference with US histogram technique is useful in excluding moderate to severe hepatic steatosis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

There are numerous controversies about dietary recommendations, especially regarding calories and macronutrients, for overweight and obese patients with DFUs. This study examined the effects of nutrition education and supplementation on body composition in overweight and obese patients with DFUs. Twenty-nine patients with DFUs between the ages of 30 and 70 years were randomly assigned to either the treatment group (nutritional supplements, diet education, and standard care) or the control group (standard care). At baseline, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 33.5 kg/m2 for the treatment group and 34.1 kg/m2 for the control group. HbA1c decreased in both groups, with no significant difference between the groups. On average, patients in the treatment group lost less lean body mass and gained less fat than the control group ((3.8 kg vs. 4.9 kg) and (0.9 kg vs. 3.6 kg), respectively). While the interaction between group and time did not reach statistical significance for any of the study variables after adjustments for confounding variables, the observed changes are clinically relevant.},

abstract = {Introduction: Few studies have evaluated the relationship between phase angle (PA) and obesity. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a commonly used method to estimate body composition. PA is the most widely used parameter of BIA for diagnosis of malnutrition and clinical prognosis. Objectives: The aim of our study is to compare the BIA and PA between a group of morbidly obese patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NALFD) and a group of non-obese patients with NALFD. Methods: Preoperative clinical and laboratory data were obtained from 100 morbidly obese patients attended in our hospital. A Biliopancreatic diversion was performed in all the patients. Seventy eight non-morbidly obese patients with NALFD were enrolled in the second group. All of them have NALFD, evaluated by liver biopsy. Results: A total of 178 patients were enrolled in the study (100 obese patients and 78 non obese patients) The average age in the obese group was 43.3±11.4 years old vs 44,7 ± 11,6 years old. BMI (Obese patients: 48.29±7.02KG/M2 vs Non obese patients 30,57±5,18 KG/M2; p<0,001). Resistance (384,05±70,84 Ohms: 488,75±72 Ohms; (p<0,001), reactance (46,23±13,67 Ohms vs 85,50±14,16 Ohms; p<0,001), PA (6,81±1,44 ° vs 7,66±1,83°; p<0,001), muscle mass (Obese patients 47,72±12,72 Kg vs non obese patients 38,78±9,44 kg; p<0,001). Conclusion: Comparing our data with those of non-obese patients, we observe that obese patients have lower phase angle than non-obese patients. The use of Bioimpedance on obese patients has led a higher precision in nutritional status.},

abstract = {Background & aims: Bioimpedance analysis-derived phase angle (PhA), as marker of body cell mass and cell integrity, might be altered in obesity, a condition which is characterized by alterations in muscle structure and function. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate whether and to which extent PhA varies in individuals/patients with excess body weight focusing on: a) changes in PhA due to obesity; b) changes in PhA after bariatric interventions or training programs. Methods: According to PRISMA criteria, a systematic literature search until February 2021 using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed. Selection criteria included studies on patients with obesity without comorbidities other than metabolic diseases. Results: A total of 278 articles were first identified. After removing duplicates and excluding studies that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria, the full text of the remaining 80 potentially relevant studies was examined to finally retrieve 11 cross-sectional and 10 longitudinal studies. Few studies have shown that PhA is lower in individuals/patients with obesity than in controls. The only study on the matter showed a decrease with age after the fourth decade of life. Four out of five studies reported consistently greater mean values in men than in women. In two studies PhA was lower in patients with severe obesity; in addition, Patients with low PhA had higher BMI and PhA was inversely correlated with fat mass. Longitudinal studies showed that PhA markedly decreased after bariatric surgery and slightly increased after training programs. Conclusions: Thus, a relatively low number of studies have evaluated PhA in individuals/patients with obesity with sometimes contradictory and preliminary results. PhA might be useful to evaluate muscle quality in individuals/patients with obesity but further studies are needed to more accurately associate this variable with changes in muscle structure and strength, as well as in metabolic functions.},

A total of 46 independent elderly people participated in the study, and they were divided into four groups according to BMI values: Group 1 (G1, BMI < 25 kg/m2); Group 2 (G2, BMI > 25–30 kg/m2); Group 3 (G3, BMI > 30–35 kg/m2); Group 4 (G4, BMI > 35 kg/m2). In addition to the weight and height used to calculate the BMI, the following body composition variables were collected: fat mass (FM), fat-free mass, intracellular water (ICW), extracellular water (ECW), total body water (TBW) and PhA (50 kHz) through InBody S10 equipment. Functional capacity was assessed using the Fullerton battery of tests: arm-curl; chair-stand; 6 min walking test (6MWT); time up-and-go test (TUG); standing on one leg (SOOL) and take 10 foot-lines (10FL). The main results showed differences between groups in the tests: 6MWT, SOOL and 10FL between G1 vs. G3 and G2 vs. G3 (p < 0.05); ACT, AIC and AEC between G1 vs. G4 (p < 0.05); FM among all groups (p < 0.05). Negative correlations were found between PhA and the agility test in G1 (r = −0.848; p = 0.008) and G4 (r = −0.909; p = 0.005); PhA and chair-stand in G3 (r = 0.527; p = 0.044); PhA and forearm flexion in G3 (r = 0.641; p = 0.010) and G4 (r = 0.943; p = 0.001); PhA and 6MWT in G4 (r = 0.771; p = 0.042).

This cross-sectional study had a non-probabilistic sample and was conducted from April to June 2018. The PhA was obtained by a bioelectrical impedance analysis, and the health-related physical fitness indicators evaluated were percentage of body fat (%BF), lower- and upper-body maximal strength, cardiorespiratory fitness (relative V̇O2peak), and flexibility. Pearson and Spearman´s linear correlations, crude and adjusted linear regression analyses were performed. A total of 69 obese adults (60.8% female; BMI = 33.5 ± 2.8 kg/m2) with a mean age of 34.6 ± 7.1 years were studied. The PhA means were 5.8 (±0.6{\textordmasculine}) and had an inverse correlation with %BF (r=−0.74; p<0.001) and positive correlation with V̇O2peak (r=0.50; p<0.001), lower- and upper-body maximal strength (r=0.65; r=0.70; p<0.001, respectively).

abstract = {Obesity is associated to chronic low-grade metabolic inflammation and hypovitaminosis D. Among extra-skeletal effects, an important role in inflammation has been described for vitamin D (25(OH)D). Phase angle (PhA) is a bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameter that represents an indicator of cellular health in chronic inflammatory states. However, it is still unknown whether a low 25(OH)D levels might correlate with PhA in obesity. Considering the lack of evidence correlating the 25(OH)D levels with PhA in obesity, the aim of this study was to investigate their possible relationship in a group of patients with obesity stratified according to body mass index (BMI) categories. Four hundred and fifty-five adult subjects (219 males and 236 females; 36 ± 11 years) were enrolled. Body composition, including PhA, was assessed using a BIA phase-sensitive system. Serum levels of 25(OH)D was determined by a direct competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay. Most of the participants were affected by grade III obesity (24%) and had 25(OH)D deficiency (67%). Subjects with 25(OH)D deficiency had highest BMI (p < 0.001). Stratifying the sample population according to the BMI classes, 25(OH)D levels decreased significantly along with the increase in BMI (p < 0.001), with the lowest 25(OH)D levels in the class III obesity. In addition, stratifying the sample population according to 25(OH)D categories, BMI and fat mass (FM) decreased, while PhA increased significantly along with the 25(OH)D categories (p < 0.001). The 25(OH)D levels showed significant positive associations with PhA (r = −0.59, p < 0.001), and this association remained significant also after adjusting for BMI and FM (r = 0.60, p < 0.001). The lowest values of PhA were significantly associated with the severity of obesity (OR 0.3, p < 0.001) and of 25(OH)D deficiency (OR 0.2, p < 0.001). To compare the relative predictive power of body composition parameters associated with the 25(OH)D levels, we performed a multiple linear regression analysis. The most sensitive and specific cut-off for 25(OH)D levels to predict the PhA above the median was >14 ng/mL (p < 0.001). In conclusion, we provided preliminary insights into a novel link between 25(OH)D levels and PhA in the setting of obesity. This association uncovered a new potential usefulness of PhA as expression of cell membrane integrity and predictor of inflammation in low 25(OH)D status that might help in identifying high-risk patients with obesity who could benefit from careful 25(OH)D supplementation.},

abstract = {Introduction. Phase angle (PhA) has been suggested to be an indicator of body cell mass and nutritional status. Clinically, the phase angle supposedly reflects body cell mass and cell membrane function, and the higher the phase angle, the better is the cell function. Muscle ultrasound (US) is an emerging nutritional assessment technique. Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness and correlation of PhA with muscle US of quadriceps rectus femoris (QRF) in obese female subjects and the relationship with quality of life and physical performance. Material and Methods. In a total of healthy 50 obese female patients, anthropometric data by BIA, muscle mass by ultrasound at the QRF level, analytical determination, blood pressure, and quality of life were measured. Physical performance was assessed, too. Results. In total, 50 female obese patients were included with a mean age of 45.9 ± 2.4 years. The mean body mass index was 32.1 ± 1.6 kg/m2 with a mean weight of 83.5 ± 14.6 kg. Correlation analysis showed a positive correlation of PhA with all US parameters corrected by squared height (anteroposterior muscle thickness, circumference, cross-sectional area, and Echo-intensity). The correlation analysis of biochemical parameters with PhA showed a positive correlation with serum albumin and total protein levels. Physical activity and vitality scores of SF36 were correlated with PhA. Finally, PhA was positive correlated with physical performance, doing push-ups in 30 seconds (r =0.42; p =0.03) and doing squats in 30 seconds (r =0.54; p =0.02), without correlation with the time of 1.5 km walk. Conclusion. PhA was correlated with muscle area, muscle circumference, muscle echo intensity, serum protein, quality of life SF-36, and strength physical performance.},

As long as we know, there are not studies of association between phase angle and adipocytokines. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association of adipocytokines levels and classical cardiovascular risk factors with tertiles of phase angle in obese women. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed to establish whether phase angle from 228 adult female patients with obesity are related with adipocitokynes and cardiovascular risk factors. These patients were studied in a Nutrition Clinic Unit after signed informed consent. All patients with a 2 weeks weight-stabilization period before recruitment were enrolled. Weight, blood pressure, basal glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP), insulin, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides blood and adypocitokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin Interleukin-6 and TNF-alpha) levels were measured. The phase angle $\alpha$ was determined by bioimpedance with the equation [PAo=(Xc/R)x(180o/$\pi$)]. Results: Two hundred and twenty-eight females gave Informed consent and were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 38.2±14.7 years and the mean BMI 35.27±6.5. Patients were divided by tertiles of phase angle. Fat mass was higher in first tertile than third tertile (43.6±12.6 vs 40.9±15 kg: p<0.05). HOMA (2.4±1.6 vs 1.46±1.6: p<0.05), insulin (14.4±8.5 vs 11.3±9.4 mUl/L: p<0.05) and glucose (102.1±20 vs 90±19.5 mg/dl: p<0.05) levels were higher in first tertile than second and third tertiles. Leptin (167.3±98 vs 104.5±80 ng/ml: p<0.05) and IL-6 (3.84±5.7 vs 1.8±2.9 pg/ml: p<0.05) levels were higher in first phase angle tertile than third tertile phase angle. Conclusion: Obese women with a low PA tertile have high fat mass with a secondary high level of glucose, HOMA, IL-6 and leptin. Perhaps, a low tertile of phase angle could be a new subrogate cardiovascular risk factor to categorize the obese patients.},

abstract = {Background: An increasing body of evidence indicates that the phase angle (PhA) can be applied as a marker of nutritional status, disease prognosis, and mortality probability. Still, it is not known whether PhA can be used as an indicator of muscular quantity and strength and maximal aerobic capacity in overweight/obese former highly active individuals, an understudied population. This study aimed to analyze the association between PhA with skeletal muscle mass, maximal isometric strength, and maximal aerobic capacity through VO2max, in overweight/obese and inactive former athletes. Methods: Cross-sectional information of 94 (62 males) former adult athletes (age: 43.1 ± 9.4 years old; body mass index: 31.4 ± 4.8 kg/m2) taking part in a weight-loss clinical trial was analyzed. Total fat and fat-free mass were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, while skeletal muscle mass was predicted from appendicular lean soft tissue. Values for upper-and lower-body maximal isometric strength were assessed by handgrip and leg press dynamometry. VO2max was determined by indirect calorimetry through a graded exercise test performed on a treadmill. Results: PhA was associated with skeletal muscle mass (r = 0.564, p < 0.001), upper-body strength (r = 0.556, p < 0.001), lower-body strength (r = 0.422, p < 0.001), and VO2max (r = 0.328, p = 0.013). These relationships remained significant for skeletal muscle mass ($\beta$ = 2.158, p = 0.001), maximal isometric strength (upper-body: $\beta$ = 2.846, p = 0.012; low-er-body: $\beta$ = 24.209, p = 0.041) after adjusting for age, sex, and fat mass but not for VO2max ($\beta$ = −0.163, p = 0.098). Conclusion: Our findings indicated that former athletes with higher values of PhA exhibited greater muscle mass and strength, despite sex, age, and body composition, which suggests that this simple raw BI parameter can be utilized as an indicator of muscle quantity and functionality in overweight/obese former athletes.},

Forty-two women (56.2 ± 9.1 years, body mass index (BMI) 37.1 ± 4.9 kg/m2) were randomly allocatedto one of two groups: a group with a highweekly training frequency of three times a week (HIGH, n= 21) and a group that performed only one weekly session (LOW, n= 21). The groups trained with an identical exercise intensity and volume per session for 6 months. Before and after the intervention period, the participants were assessed for anthropometric measures, bioimpedance analysis, and HS. There was a significant group × time interaction (p<0.05) for waist circumference, bioimpedance reactance divided by body height (Xc/H), PA, and HS measures. In addition, only the HIGH group increased Xc/H, PA, and HS after the intervention period (p<0.05), even after adjusting for weight loss and menopausal status. Physical exercise performed three times a week promotes better adaptations in PA and HSwhen compared with the same program performed once a week in obese women.},

abstract = {Phase angle (PhA) is one of the parameters for evaluating the nutritional status that reflects intra and extracellular water distribution, and reduced values are related to increased cell membrane permeability. This process can be related to oxidative stress, which favors the oxidation of biomolecules, as membrane lipids, being a characteristic disorder of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In this study, we first investigate the relationship of PhA with oxidative stress in patients with IBD. Study enrolling patients with IBD (n=31) and control group (without disease, n=21), aged between 20 to 60 years. Nutritional status was evaluated through bioimpedance. We also investigate levels of oxidative stress in plasma: Nitrite (Nox), myeloperoxidase (MPO), gluthatione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). All procedures were performed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) of Federal University of Piau{\'{i}}, Brazil, (Protocol n.4.276.832). For comparisons between groups, we used Kolmogorov-Smirnov test followed by student's t test or Mann-Whitney. Linear regression was used to correlate the variables. We have not observed a difference in PhA (IBD:6.85±0.28 vs. Control:6.72±0.24°). Compared with the control group, the IBD group has increased (p<0.05) concentrations of Nox (IBD:34.50±6.1 vs. Control:19.95±1.5$\mu$M), MDA (IBD:5.29±0.7 vs. Control:0.70±0.3nmol/$\mu$L) and activity of MPO (IBD:2.37±0.6 vs. Control:1.09±0.4U/$\mu$L). On other hand, compared the control group, IDB group decreased (p<0.05) activity of SOD (IBD:1.46±0.1 vs. Control:1.82±0.1U) and no change in GSH. MDA was negatively correlated with PhA (R2:0.37; p:0.004); and SOD was positively correlated with PhA (R2:0.36; p:0.004) in patients with IBD, but not in control group. IBD induces oxidative stress and some biomarkers were related to increased cell permeability measured by PhA. Thus, we suggest that PhA values are related to oxidative stress in patients with IBD.},

Obesity-related complications, mostly related to chronic low-grade systemic inflammation (LGI), are the commonest cause of mortality and morbidity in PWS adults. Phase angle (PhA) is an easy tool to screen a state of LGI in healthy subjects and in subjects with obesity and is obtained from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The aim of this study was to validate the PhA in PWS adults as a potential biomarker of LGI. In this single-center, cross-sectional study, fifteen PWS adults (six males, aged 19–41 years, and body mass index (BMI) 31.0–68.0 Kg/m2) and fifteen control subjects matched by gender, age, and BMI were evaluated. PhA values were significantly lower (p < 0.001), while high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in PWS adults compared with controls (p < 0.001), without a gender difference in the latter. After adjustment for gender, BMI, and waist circumference, significant correlation was found between PhA and hsCRP levels (r = −0.69, p = 0.01). At the ROC analysis, the threshold value of PhA predicting the highest hs-CRP levels above the median value was found at PhA ≤ 4.8° (p = 0.01; AUC, 0.82; standard error, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.00). These results suggest that PWS adults had a significant higher degree of LGI compared with their counterparts. Moreover, our finding suggest that PhA is a valid biomarker of LGI also in PWS adults.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) represents the most common form of genetic obesity. Studies of body composition in obese adults with PWS are limited. It is generally well-accepted that obese individuals with PWS present with higher fat mass and lower lean mass than their obese counterparts. However, no study focused on body composition evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), in particular, the phase angle, a direct BIA measurement that represents an indicator of cellular health in chronic inflammatory states, such as obesity, and a marker frequently associated with muscle strength and sarcopenia. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine differences in body composition in obese adults with PWS compared to obese adults without PWS. METHODS: In this case-controlled, cross-sectional study, we enrolled 15 obese adults with PWS (six males and nine females, age 28.80 ± 6.76 years) and 15 controls matched for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). Anthropometric measures (weight, height and waist circumference) and bioelectrical variables (Fat Mass, Lean Body Mass, Muscle Mass, Body Cell Mass Index, BCMI; Intra Cellular Water, ICW; Extra Cellular Water, ECW) were evaluated. Phase angle was calculated by BIA phase-sensitive system (50-kHz BIA 101 RJL, Akern Bioresearch, Florence, Italy Akern). Muscle strength was measured by hand grip strength using a grip strength dynamometer (Kern & Sohn GmbH). RESULTS: Compared to matched non-PWS subjects, the obese adults with PWS showed no differences in waist circumference (p = 0.248), fat mass (p = 0.256), lean mass (p = 0.198) and muscle mass (p = 0.809). However, obese adults with PWS were characterized by significant differences in the other bioelectrical variables compared with controls, with a lower phase angle (4.46 ± 0.77 vs. 5.63 ± 0.32; p < 0.001), BCMI (10.12 ± 1.75 vs. 11.13 ± 0.96; p = 0.040), ICW% (45.50 ± 5.18 vs. 52.53 ± 1.61; p < 0.001) and a higher ECW% (54.50 ± 5.18 vs. 47.47 ± 1.61; p < 0.001). In addition, hand grip strength was highly significant lower in PWS group (9.42 ± 5.07 vs. 20.35 ± 4.21 kg; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting smaller phase angles, as an indirect marker of inflammation and muscle strength, in a group of obese adults with PWS compared to obese adults without PWS. This evidence suggests a role of phase angle as adjunctive marker of the clinical severity of obese adults with PWS, which may go unrecognized using simple measures of body composition, and supports the relevance of a skilled nutritionist in the multidisciplinary management of these patients.},

abstract = {Phase angle (PhA) is a recently proposed marker of nutritional status in many clinical conditions. Its use in patients with obesity presents different critical concerns due to the higher variability of the two measured parameters (resistance, R, and reactance, Xc) that contribute to the determination of PhA. Controversial is the relation between PhA and BMI that might vary with graded levels of obesity due to the variation in fat and free fat mass. Obesity is frequently associated with metabolic, hepatic, cardiovascular and kidney diseases that introduce variations in PhA values, in relation to multimorbidity and severity degree of these diseases. It is reported that the improvement of clinical condition is associated with a positive change in PhA. Also, the treatment of obesity with weight loss might confirm this effect, but with different responses in relation to the type and duration of the intervention applied. In fact, the effect appears not only related to the percentage of weight loss but also the possible loss of free fat mass and the nutritional, metabolic and structural modifications that might follow each therapeutic approach to decrease body weight. We can conclude that the PhA could be used as marker of health status in patients with obesity supporting an appropriate weight loss intervention to monitor efficacy and fat free mass preservation.},

abstract = {Introduction: Phase Angle (PhA) is a ratio of whole body reactance and resistance obtained from Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). It indicates cellular health and integrity and is considered as prognostic tool in medical disorders. In spite of prognostic potentials of PhA, it has limited usefulness in clinical practice and in population studies because of non-availability of normal population reference limits for comparison. Moreover, it is influenced by various factors like age, sex, race and body composition (i.e. body fat, muscle mass, visceral fat, body cell mass, total body water, etc). Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate predictors of phase angle which will be useful in formulation of reference values for Indian population. Materials and Methods: BIA was performed by Tanita Body Composition Analyser on healthy adults aged 17-24 years. The inbuilt software measured the phase angle by the formula: Phase angle (PhA) = Reactance (xc)/Resistance (R)* (180/$\pi$). Phase angle values were compared across categories of age, sex, weight, height, Body Mass Index (BMI), total fat, visceral fat and muscle mass. Results: Mean value of phase angle was found to be 5.65. Phase angle was significantly (p< 0.001) higher in male than in female. Phase angle was significantly predicted from height (p< 0.001), weight (p< 0.002), muscle mass (p< 0.002) and visceral fat (p< 0.02) in multiple regression models. Conclusion: Phase angle differs across anthropometric and body composition categories. Thus height, weight and muscle mass should also be taken into consideration while deriving population specific reference limits of phase angle.},

abstract = {Rationale: Both phase angle (PA) and handgrip strenght (HGS) are considered as markers of nutritional status: phase angle decreases in different forms of malnutrition and it's also a predictor of survival, in several pathological conditions; HGS, being a useful functional capacity test for evaluating muscle strength in the general population, is a diagnostic tool for assessing malnutrition, overall nutritional risk and mortality. Aim of this study was to evaluate the association between PA and HGS in a sample of young women. Methods: 476 females, age range 18–40 years, with BMI between 10 and 25 kg/m2 consecutively undergoing a routine clinical nutritional councelling at the Clinical Nutrition Outpatient Unit, from 2015 to 2018 were included in this study. Grip strength for the right and left arms was measured with a handgrip dynamometer and bioimpedance analysis was performed at 50 kHz (DS Medica) in all subjects. The mean HGS was the average value of three handgrip measurements of the dominant hand. Patient group were split into: BMI subgroup 1 <16 kg/m2, n.114 (age 22.5 ± 5.3 y, weight 37.2 ± 4.5 kg, BMI 14.5 ± 1.2 kg/m2); BMI subgroup 2 = 16.0–18.5 kg/m2, n.171 (age 21.3 ± 5.5 y, weight 44.6 ± 3.7 kg, BMI 17.2 ± 0.7 kg/m2); BMI subgroup 3 = 18.5–25 kg/m2n.191 (age 22.8 ± 5.4 y, weight 54.8 ± 5.9 kg, BMI 21.0 ± 1.6 kg/m2). Results: both PA and mean HGS increased significantly with increasing BMI until group 3 (group1 :5.2 ± 0.9, group2 5.7 ± 0.7, group 3 6.3 ± 0.7 degrees; group1: 18.4 ± 4.6, group2 20.6 ± 4.8, group 3 23.3 ± 5.3 kg). When we performed the linear correlation between PA and HGS, we found a significantly decreasing correlation with increasing BMI (group 1: r 0,417, p = 0,00; group 2 r = 0.324, p = 0.000; group 3 r = 0,308 p = 0.000). Conclusions: Our preliminary findings shows that HGS and phase angle seems strongly associated with BMI groups in Italian young females in particular they are significantly correlated in underweight patients (Group 1 and 2). So they should be considered as good marker of nutritional status.},

abstract = {Introduction: Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is useful tool for quantifying the amount of skeletal muscle in a person's body; however, the correlation between DXA lean soft tissue mass, a muscle surrogate, and strength is not very strong, making it difficult to predict sarcopenia or cachexia risk from DXA alone. We hypothesized that the introduction of a second variable that describes muscle quality would increase the correlation between lean mass by DXA and strength. Methods: We tested this hypothesis on 129 participants (74 female) who had undergone DXA, bioimpedance analysis (BIA), and strength testing using a Biodex System 4 (Biodex Medical Systems Inc., Shirley, New York) for leg strength and a handgrip dynamometer (Sammons Preston Rolyan, Nottinghamshire, UK) for arm strength. Regression models were created with isokinetic peak torque or grip strength as the dependent variables. Results: As an independent variable alone, DXA right leg lean soft tissue (LST) mass predicted isokinetic right leg strength by Biodex with an R2 = 0.60 (p < 0.0001). When adding 50 kHz phase angle from BIA (S10, InBody, South Korea) to the regression model, the R2 increased to 0.69 (p < 0.0001). Similar results were found for both right and left arm grip strength models (Table). Phase angle from other BIA devices including the COZY 930 and X SCAN PLUS 970 (Selves Healthcare, Seoul, South Korea) increased the R2 values for leg strength to 0.70 and 0.66 (both p < 0.0001), respectively. Adding sex and age covariates increased the R2 values further but phase angle remained a significant (p < 0.01) predictor of strength. Conclusions: The combination of DXA-measured LST, a muscle mass surrogate, and BIA-measured phase angle improves upper- and lower-body strength prediction over LST mass alone. These results suggest phase angle can potentially add to a DXA scan protocol for diagnosing sarcopenia and cachexia. (Table presented).},

abstract = {Introduction: The phase angle (PA) reflects the ratio between intra- and extracellular water and it may be affected by nutritional and hydration status. Although its biological interpretation is still not clear, phase angle appears to have an important prognostic role in clinical practice, as it allows identification and monitoring of patients at risk of impaired nutritional status. The aim of this study was to estimate, in a wide range of BMI, average BIA parameters: Resistance (Res), Reactance (Xc) and phase angle (PA) that can be used as reference values. Methods: Anthropometric measurement and BIA parameters were evaluated in 4546 female patients at the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery of University Federico II, Naples, Italy since 2005 to 2016. Patients were divided in 6 groups in according to BMI range (Group 1 < = 15; Group 2 = 15-20; Group 3 = 20-30; Group 4 = 30-40; Group 5 = 40-50, Group 6 = > 50 kg/m2) Results: age, weight, BMI, Res, Xc and PA are reported in table according to BMI ranges. Age was higher (p < 0.05) in group 5 and 6 compared to other groups. Res and Xc were significantly different between groups, except for reactance that was significantly different between groups 1 and 3 and inversly correlated with BMI. PA was higher (p < 0.05) in group 5 and 6 and it was directly correlated to BMI. Conclusion: Phase angle differs across categories of BMI. These reference values of phase angle could be useful for preliminary nutritional evaluations in the clinical setting. (Table presented) .},

abstract = {Objective: Phase angle (PhA) obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis is a well-established predictor of malnutrition that reflects the amount and quality of soft tissue. However, PhA results may depend on configurations of the measurement that differ between devices. The aim was to analyze differences between devices for supine and standing measurements. Approach: In a cross-sectional study, differences in PhA were analyzed comparing supine vs. standing positions, metal vs. adhesive electrodes and the right vs. left side of the body in 302 multi-ethnic adults (18–65y) and 1298 Mexican children and adolescents (4–20y). Main results: PhA was higher in supine than in standing position (from 0.71°±0.22° in children to 0.97°±0.25° in adults; all p < 0.001) with approximately fifty percent of observed differences explained by electrode placement. PhA differences increased with increasing PhA (r = 0.419) and decreased with age (r = −0.346) in adults, but increased with PhA (r = 0.677), age (r = 0.752) and height (r = 0.737) in children (all p <0.001). In adults, PhA was higher on the right side of the body (standing 0.18°±0.17°; supine 0.36°±0.33°; p <0.001). Significance: Phase angle results are influenced by posture and electrode placement. Measurement configuration must be considered when phase angle values are compared between different devices or with literature values.},

abstract = {Rationale: Bioimpedance-derived phase angle was reported to reflect cell membrane integrity, cell size and/or distribution of intra- vs. extracellular water. It has been shown to predict outcomes, such as mortality, functional status, quality of life and length of hospital in several chronic diseases. This study aims to investigate whether phase angle predicts mortality in mixed liver diseases. Methods: We considered all patients with alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease, who participate in our cohort study. From our computer database, we retrieved the last body composition assessment (50-kHz bioelectrical impedance analysis (Nutriguard{\textregistered}, Data Input), and mid arm muscle circumference (MAMC)), the MELD score (marker of liver insufficiency) and the mortality. Phase angle was standardized (PhAst) for sex, age, and body mass index (BMI),1 and categorized as < or ≥−2.12, the median value. Univariate and multivariate Cox regressions evaluated whether PhAst predicted mortality. Results: The analysis included 132 (26% women) participants among whom 42 died (29% women; 32 patients with a PhAst < median value). Median time between measurement and death was 85 days (range 1–707). A PhAst<the median value predicts mortality (HR :4.225, 95% CI 2.074–8.606, p < 0.001.) This prediction remains significant when adjusting for MAMC (HR :3.2, 95% CI 1.457–7.011, p < 0.004), but not when adjusting for MAMC and the MELD score (HR :2.144, 95% CI 0.946–4.862, p = 0.068), suggesting that the MELD score captures the cell integrity measured with the PhAst. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that 50 kHz phase angle is a valuable prognostic indicator of mortality in liver diseases, independently of age, sex, BMI and anthropometric measurements but not of MELD score.},

Methods: We examined the medical records of 54 patients—27 with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 27 with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The patients were ≥18 y of age. Clinical data, such as Child-Pugh and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (HCC), aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis (FIB)-4 (NAFLD), nutritional parameters (body mass index [BMI], handgrip strength [HGS], and bioelectrical impedance [BIA] data) were collected. Nutritional Risk Index (NRI) was calculated. Analysis was performed using Mann–Whitney test and analysis of variance. Simple multiple linear regression for predictions (Child-Pugh in HCC, APRI and FIB-4 in NAFLD). Receiver operating characteristic curve was estimated to search a cutoff for PhA. For survival, we used the Kaplan–Meier estimator. To verify whether PhA affected patients' survival, we used the Mantel–Haenszel. Results: The prevalence of cirrhosis was high in HCC (n = 25) and low in the NAFLD (n = 4). No patient was classified as undernourished based on BMI; however, NRI showed that 74.1% of patients with HCC had nutritional risk. Child-Pugh was positively correlated with the edema index (extracellular water/total body water [ECW/TBW]) and negatively correlated with PhA and HGS. Higher Child-Pugh and BCLC scores were associated with worse NRI. APRI and FIB-4 were positively correlated with weight and BMI. A significant difference between groups was found for the median values of R, ECW/TBW, PhA, HGS, and albumin. There was a trend toward lower survival in patients with HCC, according to the cutoff point of 5.1 degrees for PhA. Conclusion: PhA was shown to be an independent prognostic indicator for cirrhosis and may be related to survival in these patients.},

abstract = {Background: In patients with cirrhosis nutritional disturbances can progress to sarcopenia, worsening the disease prognosis. Phase angle (PA) may be a useful marker for sarcopenia in this clinical population reflecting the cellular integrity level. This cross-sectional and prospective study evaluated the association between low PA values and clinical/nutritional variables in cirrhosis with emphasis on sarcopenia. Methods: Male patients with cirrhosis (n = 122) were grouped according their PA values (>4.9° or ≤ 4.9°) after performing electrical bioimpedance. Sarcopenia diagnosis was assessed by considering appendicular skeletal muscle mass indexes <7.0 kg/m2 (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and non-dominant handgrip strength (HGS) < 27 kg (dynamometry). Logistic regression model was used to examine the correlation between clinical/nutritional variables and PA values and the ROC curve area was calculated to identify the power of PA values in predicting sarcopenia. Results: Sarcopenic patients presented lower HGS (19.57 vs. 30.55, p = 0.000), PA value (4.18 vs. 5.39, p = 0.005), SM (17.17 vs. 22.00 (p = 0.05), reactance (36.76 vs. 51.11, p = 0.023), and albumin (3.10 vs. 3.75, p = 0.037), as well as higher resistance values (512.56 vs. 457.01, p = 0.021) and CRP levels (7.89 vs. 3.53, p = 0.040) than non-sarcopenic patients. Furthermore, the PA values ≤ 5.05° were able to predict with high sensitivity the diagnosis of sarcopenia in the studied population. Conclusion: In male patients with cirrhosis, low PA values may reflect disease prognosis by correlating to sarcopenia among other clinical/nutritional changes and performed as a good marker for this main nutritional complication when ≤5.05°.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is a multidimensional phenotype that describes declining physical function and a vulnerability to adverse outcomes in the setting of physical stress such as illness or hospitalization. Phase angle is a composite measure of tissue resistance and reactance measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Whether phase angle is associated with frailty and mortality in the general population is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations among phase angle, frailty and mortality. DESIGN: Population-based survey. SETTING: Third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (1988-1994). PARTICIPANTS: In all, 4,667 persons aged 60 and older. MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was defined according to a set of criteria derived from a definition previously described and validated. RESULTS: Narrow phase angle (the lowest quintile) was associated with a four-fold higher odds of frailty among women and a three-fold higher odds of frailty among men, adjusted for age, sex, race-ethnicity and comorbidity. Over a 12-year follow-up period, the adjusted relative hazard for mortality associated with narrow phase angle was 2.4 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 1.8 to 3.1) in women and 2.2 (95 % CI 1.7 to 2.9) in men. Narrow phase angle was significantly associated with mortality even among participants with little or no comorbidity. LIMITATIONS: Analyses of BIA and frailty were cross-sectional; BIA was not measured serially and incident frailty during follow-up was not assessed. Participants examined at home were excluded from analysis because they did not undergo BIA. CONCLUSIONS: Narrow phase angle is associated with frailty and mortality independent of age and comorbidity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of General Internal Medicine.},

abstract = {Introduction: Nutritional assessment is particularly difficult in liver cirrhosis (LC). However, it has been recently found that phase angle (PA) is a good indicator of nutritional status and is associated with poor prognosis in LC. This PA success is mainly due to its independence in relation to the hydration level, unlike other traditional methods of nutritional assessment, such as body mass index. The cut-off point proposed for patients with LC is PA ≤4.9°. Aims & Methods: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of PA on clinical outcomes in LC. Data collection took place from January 2018 to August 2019. Patients were evaluated within the first 72 hours of hospitalization and PA was assessed by electrical bioimpedance. The clinical outcomes evaluated were the length of stay (LOS), number of readmissions at 6 months (R6m) and mortality. Results: The sample consisted of 107 patients, predominantly male (81.3%) and with a mean age of 60.8 ± 10.6 years old. In addition to LC, 22.4% of patients also had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The sample was stratified according to the cut-off point of the PA (PA≤ 4.9° or PA >4.9°), and it was found that PA was a predictor of mortality independently of the presence of HCC and Model For End-Stage Liver Disease score (HR = 2.4, p = 0.01). In an adjusted model concerning only nutritional parameters, it was also found that having PA ≤4.9° increased 2.9 times the risk of death (HR = 2.9, p = 0.002), regardless of appendicular muscle mass, handgrip strength, gait speed and mid-arm muscle circumference. There was also a negative correlation between PA, LOS (n = 107, rS = -0.276, p = 0.004) and MELD score (n = 105; rS = -0.426; p <0.001). No significant relationship was found between PA and R6m (n = 85; rS = -0.036; p = 0.753). Conclusion: This study confirms the potential that PA presents in the categorization of patients with LC, allowing the screening of those who need more aggressive nutritional support. However, more studies with larger samples should be conducted to validate these findings and randomized controlled trials are warranted in order to understand if a personalized and more aggressive nutritional approach results in an increase in PA and consequently an enhancement in survival of LC patients.},

Aims: We aim to analyse the ability of the Phase angle (PhA) to predict the physical function in older adults. Method: 113 healthy older adults (67 female and 46 male) performed physical tests using the Fullerton Battery – Senior Fitness Test, to assess their physical fitness. Bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy was used to determine PhA at 50KHz and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry to assess body composition. Results: PhA was positively associated with functional fitness composite, chair stand, arm curl and 6 min walk test and negatively related with chair sit-and-reach and 8-foot and go (p < 0.05). Even after adjusting for potential confounding variables such as age, sex and appendicular lean soft tissue, PhA showed an association with arm curl ({\ss} = 0.23,p = 0.038), and 8-foot and go ({\ss}=-0.214,p = 0.042). Conclusions: Higher values of PhA are related with a better physical function. Regardless of sex, age, and skeletal muscle, PhA predicts body strength, agility and dynamic balance in healthy older adults.},

abstract = {Rationale: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a complex clinical syndrome manifested by cardiac muscle dysfunction and its development is closely related to nutritional status and body composition. The use of phase angle (PA), measured by bioelectrical impedance (BIA), is described as valid, even in situations with oscillations in the hydration state, and has been related to the success, survival and evolution of the disease. Methods: Patients accompanied by the ICC protocol of a general hospital in S{\~{a}}o Paulo – Brazil, were included. Individuals who were unable to apply BIA (pacemaker patients and extensive metal prostheses) were excluded from the sample. Sociodemographic data (sex and age) and anthropometric data (weight, height and Body Mass Index – BMI) were obtained with the help of Toledo scale, capacity 150 Kg and sensitivity 100 g, of a portable X-ray stadiometer. The functional class (FC) of CHF was established according to the New York Heart Association criteria, described in the Brazilian Guideline for CHF (2018). To obtain PA and muscle mass, the results of the BIA test performed with the BCM-Fresenius instrument were used. Results: The study included 24 subjects with a mean age of 81,4 (±10,58) years. The sample was composed of 19 (79.2%) men and 5 (20.8%) women, with mean PA of 3,79° (±0.98). In relation to the functional class and PA 2 (8.3%) patients were FC II with mean PA of 5.22° (±1,35°); 13 (54.2%) were FC III with mean PA of 3.95° (± 0.90°); 9 (37.5%) were FC IV with mean PA of 3.25° (±0.66°). As for muscle mass, 11 (45.8%) patients presented reduced values with mean PA of 3.36° (±0.69) while 13 (54.2%) presented normal values with mean PA of 4.16°(±1.06). Conclusions: The present study shows that patients with higher functional class or lower muscle mass presented a lower phase angle, suggesting that PA can be a good indicator of the nutritional status and prognosis of congestive heart failure.},

Early diagnosis of malnutrition in dialysis patients is extremly important for success of nutritional therapy. Malnutrition-inflammation score is useful, simple, but time consuming questionary for diagnosis of malnutrition, sarcopenia and cahexia. METHODS: Malnutrition-inflammation score and bioimpedance body mass indices: phase angle as prognostic indicator, lean tissue index, fat tissue index, hydration status (Phi, LTI, FTI, OH (over-hidration marker) are comparing in one center study (203 patients). RESULTS: Results of linear correlation between MIS and Phase angle are on the picture. High MIS means bad prognosis for malnutrition and quad vitam but low value of Phase angle has similar meaninig. Value of Phase angle is positive dependent of LTI but negative with FTI and OH. CONCLUSIONS: Negative significant correlation between Phase angle and malnutrition-inflammation score is present. Low values of Phase angle with negative prognosys in dialysis patients are connected with high malnutrition-inflammation score, which also results in bad prognosis. Phase angle is useful, simple and fast in showing malnutrition and bad prognosis in dialysis patients. Malnutrition therapy should therefore be started based on bioimpedance body mass compositions.},

@article{DenizGunes2018,
abstract = {Introduction: An accurate estimate of body composition is important in nutrition assessment and monitoring. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is the most commonly used method for assessing body composition. BIA measures body component resistance (R, pure opposition of a biological conductor to alternating electric current) and reactance (Xc, capacitive resistance of cell membranes) by recording a voltage drop in applied current. Resistance is related to the water content in the tissues, while reactance is the resistive effect produced by the tissue interfaces and cell membranes. The phase angle (PhA) is calculated directly from R and Xc. This measure has a number of advantages, such as independence from regression equations, and the fact that it can be calculated even in situations in which it is not possible to estimate the body composition. Methods: Phase angle is more appropriate than impedance for the assessment of nutritional status, because PhA presents the degree of cellular health. In healthy persons, PhA ranges from 5° to 7°. In healthy subjects, age, sex and BMI are the major determinants of PhA. Ageing is associated with decline in tissue mass, which results in decreasing PhA. Males have higher PhA values due to higher muscle mass. Higher BMI is associated with more cells, which increases PhA until a BMI of 30 kg/m2. Interestingly, at BMI >40 kg/m2, an inverse relationship with PhA is observed. This has been attributed to increased tissue hydration or a pathological fluid overload. Low PhA indicates pathological membrane state and function. Low PhA may be due to over hydration and/or malnutrition. Accordingly, many studies find a correlation between phase angle and other measures of nutritional status and/or muscle mass. Results: Phase angle has gained popularity over the past years since it has shown to be highly predictive of impaired clinical outcome and mortality in a variety of diseases. PhA is frequently lower than normal in disease since influences such as infection, inflammation or disease-specific parameters may impair phase angle. Phase angle (PhA) is a predictor of morbidity and mortality in HIV/AIDS, pancreatic, colorectal, breast and lung cancer, liver cirrhosis, dialysis, pulmonary disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, geriatric and surgical patients. Disease-related malnutrition is characterized by an early shift of fluids from intracellular water (ICW) to extracellular water (ECW) space with increased ECW/ICW and a concomitant decrease in body cell mass, both lowering phase angle. In patients suffering from malnutrition, PhA can reflect the early water shift from intracellular to extracellular space. Conclusion: In conclusion, together with the known biological determinants, malnutrition and inflammation have a strong impact on PhA in disease. Phase angle is a superior indicator of survival and outcome and should therefore be used as screening tool for identification of patients at risk because of impaired nutritional or functional status.},

abstract = {Introduction: Circadian misalignment has been associated with insulin resistance in human and animal experimental protocols. Phase angle between dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and sleep has been evaluated as a measure of circadian alignment, and has been associated with depressed mood and caloric intake. The goal of this study was to test associations between phase angle and metabolic function among healthy overweight adults. Methods: Participants included healthy overweight and obese adults (BMI > 25) aged 18-50 with sleep duration > 6.5 hours who completed 7 days of wrist actigraphy and a fasting blood draw to measure glucose and insulin. Homeostatic model of assessmentinsulin resistance (HOMA-IR), was calculated from the fasting glucose and insulin values. DLMO was evaluated in the clinical research unit and phase angle was calculated as duration between DLMO and sleep onset. BMI was calculated from measured height and weight and body fat was evaluated using dual axis absorptiometry (DXA). Data were analyzed using correlation and regression analyses controlling for age and sex. Results: Participants included 18 adults (7 F, age 29.6 + 6.9 years) with an average sleep duration was 444+ 46 minutes). Average DLMO was 22:03 +1:45 and average phase angle was 2:14+ 0:47. Average BMI was 29.0+ 3.4 kg/m2 and % body fat was 35.7+ 9.2%. Fasting glucose was 91.5+ 8.1 mg/dL, fasting insulin was 15.6+ 6.4 pmol/L and HOMA-IR was 3.5+ 1.5. Although not statistically significant, there were moderate correlations between phase angle with age (r = -0.43, p = .08) and % body fat (r = -0.45, p = .06). Phase angle was not associated with sleep duration, sleep timing or DLMO. In multivariable models, shorter phase angle was associated with higher insulin (B(SE) = -5.2 (1.9), p = .018) and HOMA (B(SE) = -1.3 (0.45), p = .015). Phase angle was not associated with fasting glucose. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that phase angle, even among healthy overweight adults with at least 6.5 hours sleep duration, is associated with metabolic measures.},

abstract = {Introduction: The phase angle (PA) reflects the ratio between intra- and extracellular water and it may be affected by nutritional and hydration status. Although its biological interpretation is still not clear, phase angle appears to have an important prognostic role in clinical practice, as it allows identification and monitoring of patients at risk of impaired nutritional status. The aim of this study was to estimate, in a wide range of BMI, average BIA parameters: Resistance (Res), Reactance (Xc) and phase angle (PA) that can be used as reference values. Methods: Anthropometric measurement and BIA parameters were evaluated in 4546 female patients at the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery of University Federico II, Naples, Italy since 2005 to 2016. Patients were divided in 6 groups in according to BMI range (Group 1 < = 15; Group 2 = 15-20; Group 3 = 20-30; Group 4 = 30-40; Group 5 = 40-50, Group 6 = > 50 kg/m2) Results: age, weight, BMI, Res, Xc and PA are reported in table according to BMI ranges. Age was higher (p < 0.05) in group 5 and 6 compared to other groups. Res and Xc were significantly different between groups, except for reactance that was significantly different between groups 1 and 3 and inversly correlated with BMI. PA was higher (p < 0.05) in group 5 and 6 and it was directly correlated to BMI. Conclusion: Phase angle differs across categories of BMI. These reference values of phase angle could be useful for preliminary nutritional evaluations in the clinical setting. (Table presented) .},

Results: The mean preoperative handgrip strength (31.48 kg, SD 9.97) correlates significantly with the postoperative body composition up to 24 months after surgery. Preoperative PhA, gender, size, and body weight influenced postoperative weight loss significantly. A significant correlation between preoperative PhA (mean 6.18°, SD 0.89°) and total weight loss (%TWL) was observed up to 3 months after SG (r = 0.31444, p = 0.0218) and up to 12 months after GB (r = 0.19184, p = 0.0467). The optimum cutoff for the prediction of a response of less than 50% excess weight loss was a preoperative PhA of 6.0°. Conclusions: The preoperative handgrip strength confirmed its suitability for use as a predictor of postoperative body composition, whereas the preoperative PhA predicts postoperative weight loss after bariatric surgery. Further research is necessary to identify the role of these parameters for preconditioning.},

It has a unique advantage in diagnosing early malnutrition related to diseases by the detection of human body cell membrane integrity and fluid composition change, and being associated with bad disease prognosis in part of clinical research. Because of its non-invasive, convenient, accurate and affordable technique, it has a wide prospect of clinical application. However, lack of uniform PA reference value somehow limited its application. We summarize the latest clinical research and application situation of PA, and explore the characteristics and the influence factors of PA in different disease group, in order to provide theoretical basis for the Chinese PA reference range.},

abstract = {Background: A low phase angle (PA) has been associated with negative outcome in specific diseases. However, many patients suffer from several co-morbidities. This study aims at identifying the impact of the type and the severity of diseases on PA in a retrospective cohort study of older people. Methods: We included all people ≥65 years who underwent a PA measurement (Nutriguard{\textregistered}) between 1990 and 2011 at the Geneva University Hospitals. PA was standardized for gender, age and body mass index according to German reference values. Co-morbidities were reported in form of the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale which considers 14 different organs/systems (disease categories), each rated from 0 (healthy) to 4 (severe illness) (severity grades). The association between the diseases categories and standardized PA was evaluated by a multivariate linear regression. For each significant disease category, we performed univariate regression models. The adjusted R2 was used to identify the best predictors of standardized PA. We considered that the severity grade affected standardized PA if there was a progressive decrease in the regression coefficients. Results: We included 1181 people (37% women). The multivariate regression model showed that the disease categories explain 17% of the variance of standardized PA. Many disease categories affect standardized PA and the ones best associated with standardized PA were the hematopoietic and vascular (R2 7.4%), the musculo-skeletal (R2 5.5%) and the respiratory (R2 4.0%) diseases. The regression coefficients in the univariate linear regression model decreased progressively with higher severity grades in respiratory (-0.15, -0.27, -0.55, -0.67) and musculo-skeletal diseases (-0.09, -0.46, -0.85, -0.86). Conclusions: Many different diseases affect standardized PA. The higher the severity grade in musculo-skeletal and respiratory diseases, the lower is the standardized PA.},

abstract = {Aims: Body cell mass is directly proportional to the bioimpedance phase-angle which is an indicator of the amount of electrical charge that cell membranes can hold and is an index of cellular health and function. To evaluate whether the bioimpedance phase angle is relevant for indicating catabolism in people with diabetes and whether it discriminates between people with diabetes receiving different types of therapy. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in 182 people with Type 2 diabetes and 107 age- and BMI-matched control subjects. The phase angle was measured at 5, 50 and 100 kHz using multifrequency bioimpedance analysis. The phase angles were compared among different diabetes therapy groups (untreated patients with diabetes, patients receiving oral antidiabetic drugs and patients receiving insulin therapy). Results: The phase angle at 100 kHz strongly correlated with total body potassium (r = 0.70, P = 0.001), and was therefore a good indicator of body cell mass. The phase angle at 100 kHz discriminated more strongly between patients with Type 2 diabetes and control subjects than did the phase angle at 50 kHz. Compared with control subjects, patients with Type 2 diabetes had a smaller phase angle at 100 kHz (men: 5.2° vs. 4.5°, P < 0.0001; women: 4.8° vs. 4.2°, P < 0.0001) and a smaller phase angle at 50 kHz (men: 5.9° vs. 5.3°, P < 0.0001; women: 5.4° vs. 4.8°, P = 0.0001), but a larger phase angle at 5 kHz (men: 2.0° vs. 2.6°, P = 0.0001; women: 2.3° vs. 3.0°, P = 0.00001). Phase angle ratios better discriminated between patients and control subjects than phase angles alone (phase angle at 5 kHz/ phase angle at 50 kHz ratio, P = 1.51 × 10-16; phase angle at 5kHz/phase angle at 100 kHz ratio, P = 2.13 × 10-15). No differences were found among phase angles in the different therapy groups. In patients with diabetes, the phase angle at 50 kHz and the phase angle at 100 kHz correlated inversely with duration of disease (men: P = 0.026, P = 0.016; women: only phase angle at 100 kHz, P = 0.003) and with HbA1c concentration (men: P = 0.010, P = 0.001; women: P = 0.007, P = 0.043). Conclusions: The phase angle at 100 kHz is a promising measurement for assessing catabolic state in people with diabetes. What's new?: The bioimpedance phase angle is an indicator of the amount of electrical charge that cell membranes can hold and is an index of cellular health and function. The phase angle at 100kHz better discriminates between people with Type 2 diabetes and people without diabetes than the phase angle at 50 kHz. The phase angle at 100 kHz is lower in people with diabetes and might be a helpful diagnostic marker in Type 2 diabetes. The phase angle at 100 kHz positively correlates with total body potassium which is indicative of body cell mass; thus, it might be useful for routine assessment of catabolic state and poor control in people with diabetes.

abstract = {Background: Phase angle measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) may be a marker of health state. Objective: This historical cohort study of prospectively collected BIA measurements aims to investigate the link between phase angle and mortality in older people and evaluate whether a phase angle cutoff can be defined. Design: We included all adults aged ≥65 years who underwent a BIA measurement by the Nutriguard{\textregistered} device at the Geneva University Hospitals. We retrieved retrospectively the phase angle and comorbidities at the last BIA measurement and mortality until December 2012. We calculated phase angle standardized for sex, age, and body mass index (BMI), using reference values determined with the same brand of BIA device. Sex-specific and standardized phase angle were categorized into quartiles. The association of mortality with sex-specific or standardized phase angle was evaluated through univariate and multivariate Cox regression models, Kaplan-Meier curves, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: We included 1307 (38% women) participants, among whom 628 (44% women) died. In a multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for comorbidities and setting of measurement (ambulatory vs. hospitalized), the protective effect against mortality increased progressively as the standardized phase angle quartile increased (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.58, 0.86], 0.53 [95% CI 0.42, 0.67], and 0.32 [95% CI 0.23, 0.43]). The discriminative value of continuous standardized phase angle, assessed as the area under the ROC curve, was 0.72 (95%CI 0.70, 0.75). We could not define an acceptable phase angle cutoff for individual prediction of mortality (LK), based on sensibility and specificity values. Conclusions: This study shows the association of phase angle and mortality in older patients, independent of age, sex, comorbidities, BMI categories, and setting of measurement.},

abstract = {Rationale: Body composition may be determinant for cancer progression and treatments. This pilot longitudinal study in cancer, aimed to characterise body composition, concomitantly with phase angle (PA); we also explored potential associations with cancer variables: histological aggressiveness and stage. Methods: We included 26 pts with solid tumours at various stages. Height+weight were determined with a Seca{\textregistered} scale+stadiometer. BMI was calculated and categorised according to WHO's criteria; % body fat mass (%FM) and phase angle (PA) were assessed by tetrapolar multifrequency bioelectrical impedance (Biodynamics 450{\textregistered}, Seattle, USA); %FM and PA were compared with age/sex reference values: percentage intervals and percentiles, respectively. Descriptive analysis was performed. Results: Stages III/IV and moderately/poorly differentiated cancers were prevalent: 54% and 69%, respect tively. By BMI, 47% pts were overweight/obese vs 6% underweight. Excessive FM was prevalent (65%) and also found in pts with normal BMI. Overall, 29% of pts had PA< 5th percentile. The prevalence of stage III/IV and moderately/poorly differentiated cancers was similar in normal BMI/FM as it was in obesity/high FM. In what concerns PA, 86% pts with PA< 5th percentile, had cancers of stages III/IV and moderate/low differentiation vs pts with PA >5th percentile, of which 41% and 63% had advanced and more aggressive cancers, respectively. Conclusion: Excessive adiposity by BIA was prevalent and underestimated by BMI. Advanced stage and more aggressive cancers, indicators of worse disease status, were significantly related with a lower PA. Thus, body composition analysis complemented with PA determination, both simple and quick for routine use, seem to bear a high clinical relevance. These preliminary results do support the continuation of this longitudinal, with additional in depth and validation analyses, as well as to study targeted nutritional interventions.},

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of PhA on postoperative adverse outcomes and length of hospitalization in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: A prospective randomised study was conducted in tertiary hospital. The PhA of 779 cardiosurgical patients was evaluated using BIA one day before surgery. After applying randomisation criteria 521 patients were classified into two groups in accordance to PhA value cutoff point of 4.7. Associations between low phase angle (LPhA≤4.7) and adverse postoperative outcomes defined by STS postoperative risk evaluation model were analysed. Additionally, the impact of LPhA on length of stay in ICU and hospital were assessed. Results: LPhA was detected in 71 (13.6%) patients in the randomized group. LPhA was associated with higher rates [8 (11.8%) vs. 19 (4.4%), p = 0.021] and risk of prolonged ventilation (OR = 2.877, 95% CI 1.206 6.863; p = 0.017). Postoperative morbidity was higher in LPhA group [14 (20.3%) vs. 47 (10.6%), p = 0.021]. Univariate regression analysis revealed LPhA as predictor of postoperative morbidity (OR = 2.145, 95% CI 1.108 4.150; p = 0.023) which persisted as an independent factor in multivariate regression analysis (OR = 2.032, 95% CI 1.035 3.992; p = 0.039). Evaluation of hospitalization length showed longer postoperative stay in ICU (3.94±3.8 vs. 2.75±4.1, p = 0.025) and prolonged hospitalization (>14 days) rate [39 (57.4%) vs. 153 (34.8%), p < 0.000] in the group with LPhA. In further statistical analysis univariate regression reported LPhA as indicator of hospitalization longer than 14 days (OR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.501 4.239; p < 0.000). Conclusion: A substantial group of cardiac surgery patients have a LPhA which is associated with postoperative morbidity, prolonged stay in ICU and hospital.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phase angle (PhA) is a raw BIA variable that has been gaining attention in recent years because it is supposed to be an index of the ratio between extracellular and intracellular water, body cell mass, and cellular integrity. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the variability of PhA between different sports and its relationships with sport performance. Additionally, we investigated whether PhA depends on gender or age, and analyzed the differences between athletes and controls. METHODS: A systematic research using PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science up to June 2019 was performed. Selection criteria included studies on subjects who practice sports in planned and continuous modality at competitive or elite level. RESULTS: Thirty-five papers met the inclusion criteria (twenty-one cross-sectional data, fourteen longitudinal data). A few but convincing studies have shown that mean PhA is higher in athletes vs. controls. PhA increases with age and is likely to be higher in male than female athletes. A large variability in PhA is observed for the same sport, while it is still uncertain to what extent PhA differs between various sports. There are no clear relationships of PhA with sport performance or training/untraining. CONCLUSION: It is still to be defined to what extent PhA varies between different sports and changes with training/untraining. It can be argued that for a given sport much more data should be collected in a systematic way and for a period of time appropriate in order to determine changes and trends. This is even more crucial in the case of intervention studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis syndrome is common in chronic kidney disease and is associated with high mortality, particularly in dialysis patients. Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) is a simple and noninvasive method for nutritional assessment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between phase angle (PA) and other nutritional parameters and establish its role as predictor of mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. METHOD: Prevalent PD patients were enrolled in the longitudinal prospective study in a single tertiary center between 2015 and 2020, with a simultaneous BIA assessment and a modified peritoneal equilibration test. Spearman's correlation test was used to assess relevant clinical associations. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan- Meier test and univariate and multivariate Cox analysis to determine the predictive factors of all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 49 PD patients were included with mean age 55.9 ± 16.2 years, 57.1% male, Charlson comorbidity index 4.9 ± 2.3, Kt/V 2.5 ± 0.7, with a mean follow-up of 39.9 ± 26.3 months. The Spearman's correlation test showed a very strong positive association between PA and extracellular mass/body cell mass (r = 0.939, P < 0.001). It also showed a moderate positive association between PA and albumin (r = 0.524, P < 0.001) and normalized protein catabolism rate (r = 0.437, P = 0.002). Furthermore, PA was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.477, P = 0.001). In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with PA < 4.9° had a lower survival rate (log rank = 4.77; P = 0.029). Using the multivariate Cox regression, forward model, PA (HR = 0.243; 95% CI 0.079-0.753), the number of cardiovascular events (HR = 11.236; 95% CI 1.286-98.211) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (HR = 1.360; 95% CI 1.033-1.790) were predictors of all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: Lower PA appears to be associated with a decline in nutritional status, so monitoring it can be useful to identify patients at higher risk of malnutrition. PA was also validated as an independent predictor of mortality in our PD patients.},

abstract = {Rationale: The Phase Angle (PA) consists in a tool that detects changes in body composition and cell membrane function, and can be used as an indicator of prognosis in varied populations. So the aim of this research was to evaluate the correlation between PA and outcomes in surgical cancer patients. Methods: Observational study developed from December 2012 to February 2014 in a Public Hospital of Brazil. Patients, of both genders, admitted to elective surgical treatment of cancer of the head and neck and gastrointestinal tract were enrolled in the study. The patients, after signing the informed consent, underwent nutritional assessment in the immediate preoperative period. Nutritional status was evaluated by Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), weight loss percentage, body mass index and body composition by Bioelectrical Impedance, which provided the PA. The outcome variables evaluated were: length stay after operation and in intensive care unit (ICU), hospitalization time as well as mortality. Results: 77 patients, mean age 61.1±11.7 years, 53.2% male were evaluated. According to SGA 43.2% of patients were malnourished. The mean postoperative length stay was 9.1±3.2 days. Around 22.1% of the sample was transferred to the ICU after the operation, with persistence of 3.4±1.8 days. The death occurred in 2.6% of patients. There was significant indirect correlation between PA and postoperative length stay (r= 0.390; p<0.001) and permanence in ICU (r= 0.354, p=0.002). Patients who died had lower PA (4.3±2.5 vs. 5.2±1.8; p=0.001). Conclusion: The PA in surgical cancer patients was associated with worse clinical outcome, suggesting that PA can be used as a prognosis indicator for this population.},

Measurements: Weight, height, body mass index (BMI), calf circumference (CC), hand grip strength (HGS), gait speed (GS), fat free mass (FFM), body fat (BF), PA with R and Xc from the BIA were measured. Spearman's and Pearson's correlations and the odds ratio (OR) were performed using the IBM SPSS software version 22.0. Results: Sixty-four percent (n=98) women are with PA below the reference. Negative moderate significant correlation was found between PA and age (r =−0.440*; p<0.001). Moderate significant correlation was observed between PA and GS (r = 0.484**; p<0.001). Weak significant correlation was found between PA and HGS (r = 0.177*; p = 0.029). Odds ratio (OR) demonstrated that individuals with PA above the mean value have 4.77 times more chances of having increased GS (confidence interval 2.40–9.48; 95%). Women aged below the mean value have 4.02 times more chances of having higher PA (confidence interval 2.02–7.99; 95%).

abstract = {Rationale: Abnormal body composition and a decreased phase angle (PA) are indicators of adverse outcomes in several surgical populations, including poor quality of life, perioperative mortality, longer hospital stay, higher incidence of infection, and higher overall health care cost. In the present study, we investigate the association between PA assessed by preoperative bioimpedance (BIA) with postoperative complications in patients with colorectal neoplasia undergoing abdominal surgery with curative intent. Methods: Transversal observational study carried out in patients with colorectal cancer undergoing curative surgery. The body composition analysis was determined by BIA. PA was result of the relation between reactance (Xc) and resistance. The diagnosis of sarcopenia was established based on the criteria of The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2). Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model. All P-values were 2-sided, and those < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The study was conducted in 50 patients hospitalized with colorectal neoplasia undergoing abdominal surgery with curative intent. The mean age was 68.32 years (SD 15.98) and 56% (N = 28) were males. 52% of the patients presented sarcopenia, with a predominance in women. (81,1 % (N= 18)). The mean of length of stay was 6,38 days (SD 2,97). There was a negative correlation between PA and length of stay (p = 0,0001). Conclusion: Sarcopenia is prevalent condition in patients with colorectal cancer. Phase angle is a predictor of longer hospital stay. Disclosure of Interest: None declared},

abstract = {Bio-impedance analysis (BIA) is a common technique used to estimate body composition. BIA measures the electrical impedance in water contained in a subject's body and uses this measurement to predict body composition. Phase angle is one of the components of body composition and is a major indicator of body fat percentage. Although BIA is less accurate when predicting body composition compared to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or bod pods, it is cheaper, more portable, and does not require a licensed operator. For those reasons, athletes commonly use BIA to estimate body fat composition. Current BIA techniques are shown to be inaccurate for very athletic individuals [1] since it is calibrated based on the general population. Previous studies have calculated phase angle distribution in elite athletes using DXA data, but none have examined BIA. Our research uses empirical Bayesian analysis with BIA data to create reference percentiles for phase angle by sport and gender among elite European athletes. .},

abstract = {Introduction: Phase angle (PA) has been considered as a prognostic factor for several clinical conditions, probably because of its relationship to fat-free mass and function. More recently, decreased muscle mass and functional assessment were used to define sarcopenia. The purpose of this work was to identify the relationship of PA, sarcopenia and its components in cancer patients. Methods: Fifty-nine cancer patients hospitalized for elective surgery were studied. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA Quantum II, RJL Systems{\textregistered}) was performed in all patients and skeletal muscle index, using Janssen equation, and PA and Standardized Phase Angle (SPA) were estimated, using reference values from this population. The handgrip strength was obtained using Jamar{\textregistered} hydraulic dynamometer, and gait speed was assessed by using 4-m test. The diagnosis of sarcopenia was performed according the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. Malnutrition was assessed by Patient-generated Subjective Global Assessment. The outcomes evaluated were postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo classification) and length of stay (LOS). Results: Sarcopenia was present in 17% of the patients and malnutrition in 30.5%. SPA was significantly lower in malnourished (-0.20 vs. 0.62 p = 0.028) and sarcopenic patients (-0.39 vs. 0.59 p = 0.010). Patients with a lower handgrip strength (-0.31 vs. 0.69 p = <0.001) and slower gait speed (-0.30 vs. 0.60 p = 0.016) also showed a lower SPA. SPA and PA from non-sarcopenic patients with impaired functions also showed a lower SPA and PA than those with normal function. Patients with serious postoperative complications (-0.71 vs. 0.41 p = 0.007) and longer LOS (-0.16 vs. 0.64 p = 0.030) presented lower SPA. The same results were found when PA (adjusted for sex and age) was used. Conclusions: PA was decreased in all the sarcopenia components, and it has been associated with impaired nutritional and functional status in this sample.},

abstract = {Phase angle (PhA), a parameter of bioelectrical impedance analysis, is a well-known predictor of morbidity and mortality in various diseases. The causes of decreased PhA are, however, not yet completely understood. We therefore investigated determinants of PhA in 777 hospitalised patients in a retrospective analysis. PhA was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis at 50 KHz. Subjective global assessment (SGA) was used to evaluate nutritional status. Age, sex, BMI as well as nutritional status (SGA), benign or malignant disease and C-reactive protein (CRP) were investigated as potential determinants of PhA and standardised PhA (SPhA) = (observed PhA - mean PhA of reference values)/standard deviation of reference values in a general linear model regression analysis. Next to age (estimated effect size, 46{\textperiodcentered}6%; P<0{\textperiodcentered}0001), malnutrition (39{\textperiodcentered}1%; P<0{\textperiodcentered}0001) emerged as a major PhA determinant in our study population. Moreover, sex (6{\textperiodcentered}4%; P<0{\textperiodcentered}0001), CRP (4{\textperiodcentered}4%; P<0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and BMI (3{\textperiodcentered}5%; P < 0{\textperiodcentered}0001) exhibited a significant influence on PhA, whereas malignant disease showed no significant effect in this model. The only significant determinants of SPhA were malnutrition (85{\textperiodcentered}4%; P<0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and inflammation (9{\textperiodcentered}6 %; P<0{\textperiodcentered}0001). In conclusion, next to the established predictors, malnutrition and inflammation have a strong impact on PhA in sick individuals, which partly explains its prognostic power. When investigating the SPhA, only malnutrition and inflammation were found to be significant predictors, as a result of which the SPhA is considered a more suitable indicator of nutritional and health status.},

abstract = {Background: Although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is commonly associated with obesity, it is increasingly being identified in non-obese individuals. We aimed to characterise the prevalence, incidence, and long-term outcomes of non-obese or lean NAFLD at a global level. Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from inception to May 1, 2019, for relevant original research articles without any language restrictions. The literature search and data extraction were done independently by two investigators. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of non-obese or lean people within the NAFLD group and the prevalence of non-obese or lean NAFLD in the general, non-obese, and lean populations; the incidence of NAFLD among non-obese and lean populations; and long-term outcomes of non-obese people with NAFLD. We also aimed to characterise the demographic, clinical, and histological characteristics of individuals with non-obese NAFLD. Findings: We identified 93 studies (n=10 576 383) from 24 countries or areas: 84 studies (n=10 530 308) were used for the prevalence analysis, five (n=9121) were used for the incidence analysis, and eight (n=36 954) were used for the outcomes analysis. Within the NAFLD population, 19{\textperiodcentered}2% (95% CI 15{\textperiodcentered}9–23{\textperiodcentered}0) of people were lean and 40{\textperiodcentered}8% (36{\textperiodcentered}6–45{\textperiodcentered}1) were non-obese. The prevalence of non-obese NAFLD in the general population varied from 25% or lower in some countries (eg, Malaysia and Pakistan) to higher than 50% in others (eg, Austria, Mexico, and Sweden). In the general population (comprising individuals with and without NAFLD), 12{\textperiodcentered}1% (95% CI 9{\textperiodcentered}3–15{\textperiodcentered}6) of people had non-obese NAFLD and 5{\textperiodcentered}1% (3{\textperiodcentered}7–7{\textperiodcentered}0) had lean NAFLD. The incidence of NAFLD in the non-obese population (without NAFLD at baseline) was 24{\textperiodcentered}6 (95% CI 13{\textperiodcentered}4–39{\textperiodcentered}2) per 1000 person-years. Among people with non-obese or lean NALFD, 39{\textperiodcentered}0% (95% CI 24{\textperiodcentered}1–56{\textperiodcentered}3) had non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 29{\textperiodcentered}2% (21{\textperiodcentered}9–37{\textperiodcentered}9) had significant fibrosis (stage ≥2), and 3{\textperiodcentered}2% (1{\textperiodcentered}5–5{\textperiodcentered}7) had cirrhosis. Among the non-obese or lean NAFLD population, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 12{\textperiodcentered}1 (95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}5–38{\textperiodcentered}8) per 1000 person-years, that for liver-related mortality was 4{\textperiodcentered}1 (1{\textperiodcentered}9–7{\textperiodcentered}1) per 1000 person-years, cardiovascular-related mortality was 4{\textperiodcentered}0 (0{\textperiodcentered}1–14{\textperiodcentered}9) per 1000 person-years, new-onset diabetes was 12{\textperiodcentered}6 (8{\textperiodcentered}0–18{\textperiodcentered}3) per 1000 person-years, new-onset cardiovascular disease was 18{\textperiodcentered}7 (9{\textperiodcentered}2–31{\textperiodcentered}2) per 1000 person-years, and new-onset hypertension was 56{\textperiodcentered}1 (38{\textperiodcentered}5–77{\textperiodcentered}0) per 1000 person-years. Most analyses were characterised by high heterogeneity. Interpretation: Overall, around 40% of the global NAFLD population was classified as non-obese and almost a fifth was lean. Both non-obese and lean groups had substantial long-term liver and non-liver comorbidities. These findings suggest that obesity should not be the sole criterion for NAFLD screening. Moreover, clinical trials of treatments for NAFLD should include participants across all body-mass index ranges. Funding: None.},

Forty C57BL/6 male mice were divided into standard diet (SD), high-fat diet (HFD), standard diet with eugenol (SDE) and high-fat diet with eugenol (HFDE). The dose used of eugenol was 500 mg kg−1 for 8 weeks. Eugenol did not prevent weight gain, but it was effective in preventing hepatic lipid accumulation evidenced by the presence of fat droplets in the HFD group and absence in the HFDE group. An improvement in the gut microbiota profile was observed, proved by an increase in the Actinobacteria phylum in the treated groups and a reduction of Proteobacteria phylum in the HFDE group. Despite not preventing weight gain, eugenol appeared to have a protective effect on hepatic lipid accumulation and beneficially modulate the gut microbiota in mice fed with HFD.},

abstract = {Background: Osteoporosis has scarcely been prospectively investigated in short-bowel syndrome (SBS). This prospective study was designed to evaluate incretins, adipokines, bone mass, and lipid deposits from marrow adipose tissue (MAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and liver (IHLs). Methods: The study comprised 2 groups matched by gender, height, and age: the control group (CG) (9 males, 9 females) and the SBS group (SBSG) (6 males, 5 females). The SBSG was evaluated twice in an interval of 1 year (SBSG0 and SBSG1). The biochemical evaluation included incretins, leptin, and adiponectin. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance were, respectively, used to measure BMD and lipid deposits. Results: Bone mineral density (BMD) was lower in the SBSG than in the CG, but there was no difference between SBSG0 and SBSG1. There was no difference in MAT, SAT, and VAT, but IHL was lower in CG than in SBSG0 and SBSG1. A negative correlation between MAT and third lumbar vertebrae BMD was found in the CG but not in SBSG0 or SBSG1. There was a negative association between IHL and bone mass considering all participants (CG and SBSG0) (R2 = 0.38; P <.05). Conclusion: Appropriate nutrition assistance recovers body composition, reverts the relationship of bone mass and MAT, and mitigates bone loss in SBS. In spite of this, osteoporosis seems to be an early and persistent complication in SBS. Curiously, SBS seems to be a highly vulnerable condition for the development of hepatic steatosis and shows an association between bone mass and IHL.},

abstract = {Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is known to be the most common liver disease in the world, and there are currently no approved pharmacological treatments to prevent or treat this condition. In addition to being associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, NAFLD has now become the leading cause of liver failure-associated transplantation. The 16S rRNA gene which conserved regions can serve as universal primer binding sites for PCR amplification of gene fragments, while hypervariable regions contain significant sequence diversity useful for prokaryotic identification purposes. 16S rRNA gene sequences can be use by researchers to identify prokaryotic taxonomy found in clinical samples. As a result of increasing microbiota studies with developing technological developments, the role of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of NAFLD is revealed in an important way. In this study, it was aimed to determine the clinical prognostic importance of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and to determine the microbial composition with intestinal mucosal biopsy samples in NAFLD patients. Material and method: We included 20 patients diagnosed with NAFLD as a result of liver function tests, histological, ultrasonographic, biopsy evidence and 20 normal control groups created under exclusion criteria in this study. The healthy control group of the same age and gender as the patients were determined to be equal, and the age, gender, BMI, insulin resistance, AST, ALT levels of the individuals were recorded for analysis. İntestinal mucosal biopsy samples were taken from the individuals included in the study under sterile conditions. Microbial results were obtained as a result of 16S rRNA amplicon metagenomic processes. The region of approximately 1500 bp covering the V1-V9 region of the 16S rRNA gene was targeted to detect microbial diversity. The amplified regions were sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) value was obtained with bioinformatics software with the obtained sequence data. The analysis of the recorded parameters was done with the SPSS.19 statistical program. Results: In the designed study, 16 phyla, 28 class, 56 order, 128 family, 415 genera, 1041 species microorganisms were analyzed taxonomically in a total of 40 individuals. In our study, Intestinal microbial diversity is lower in NAFLD patients compared to control group individuals. In addition, gram-negative bacteria were found to be more dominant in NAFLD patients. As a phylum, Proteobacteria increased in NAFLD group, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria in control group, while Firmicutes had equal distribution in both groups. BMI OR = 6.37, 95 %CI (0.39–0.40) p value was 0.001 in laboratory data, whereas Proteobacteria OR = 1.754, 95% CI (0.901–3.416), p value 0.05 in microbial profile. Conclusion: The 16S rRNA metagenomic study of intestinal microbiota using colonic mucosal biopsy samples in NAFLD disease was the first study in the Turkish population, and important data were obtained for other studies. In the data obtained, we think Proteobacteria, Ruminococcaceae, Escherichia coli and Bacilli are very important in both diagnostic and treatment options as a microbial profile in NAFLD.},

In particular, high-fat and high-fructose diets have been shown to increase intestinal permeability, which can expose the liver to endotoxins. Indeed, accumulating evidence points to a link between these liver diseases and the intestinal axis, including dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and leaky-gut syndrome. Here, we review the mechanisms contributing to these links between the liver and small intestine in the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH, focusing on the roles of intestinal microbiota and their metabolites to influence enzymes essential for proper liver metabolism and function. Advances in next-generation sequencing technology have facilitated analyses of the metagenome, providing new insights into the roles of the intestinal microbiota and their functions in physiological and pathological mechanisms. This review summarizes recent research linking the gut microbiome to liver diseases, offering new research directions to elucidate the detailed mechanisms and novel targets for treatment and prevention.},

abstract = {1 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a growing epidemiological/economic burden. NAFLD 2 is associated to western diet (WD) patterns, and its pathogenesis involves metabolic disorders (obesity, 3 dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and diabetes) and gut dysbiosis, features that are usually neglected or not 4 reproduced by most animal models. We established a 6-month WD-induced NAFLD mouse model 5 associated to metabolic disorder, investigating its main features at the gut microbiome-adipose tissue-liver 6 axis. Male C57BL6 mice received a high-fat (30% lard and 0.2% cholesterol, $\sim$57% calories) and sucrose-7 rich (20%) chow, and a high sugar solution (23.1 and 18.9 g/L of D-fructose and D-glucose) for 6 months. 8 This model featured high serum cholesterol levels, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. WD 9 intervention resulted in extensive macro/microvesicular liver steatosis and pericellular fibrosis-resembling 10 human disease-accompanied by hepatic stellate cell activation and CD68+ macrophage infiltration, 11 increased protein levels of pro-inflammatory p65-NF$\kappa$B, IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$, while decreased antioxidant 12 regulator Nrf2. Mice showed clear obesity with adipocyte hypertrophy, and CD68+macrophage/mast cell 13 infiltration in adipose tissue while a reduction in number of goblet cells was also observed in the small 14 intestine. Moreover, the pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA of gut cecal content showed decreased 15 bacterial diversity, enriched Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, decreased Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria, and 16 increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Bacteroidetes and Bacteroides had the highest number of 17 significant correlations with liver-adipose tissue axis outcomes. In silico analysis of gut microbiome in 18 NAFLD-obese patients revealed a depletion in Bacteroides, that also correlated to disease outcomes. In 19 conclusion, our mice model gathered suitable phenotypical alterations in gut-liver-adipose tissue axis that 20 resembled NAFLD associated to metabolic disorders in humans, and may be considered for preclinical 21 investigation. 22 23 24},

However, the deficiency of the characterization of microbial and metabolite signatures largely impedes the symptomatic treatment. Methods: For the purpose, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 20 patients with MAFLD (short for “M”), 20 cases with MAFLD and T2DM (short for “MD”), together with 19 healthy donors (short for “Ctr”). Microbial and metabolite analyses were further conducted to explore the similarities and differences among the aforementioned populations based on feces and blood samples, respectively. Results: Compared with those in the Ctr group, patients with M or MD revealed multifaceted similarities (e.g., Age, ALP, LDL, BUN) and distinctions in clinical indicators of liver (e.g., BMI, ALT, PCHE, CAP). With the aid of microbial and metabolite analyses as well as bioinformatic analyses, we found that the characteristics of gut microbiota (e.g., abundance, hierarchical clustering, cladogram, species) and lipid metabolism (e.g., metabolite, correlation coefficient and scatter plot) were distinct among the indicated groups. Conclusions: The patients with MD revealed multifaceted similarities and distinctions in characteristics of microbiome and metabolites with those in the M and HD groups, and in particular, the significantly expressed microbes (e.g., Elusimicrobiota, Berkelbacteria, Cyanobacteria, Peregrinibacteria) and lipid metabolites (e.g., Lipid-Q-P-0765, Lipid-Q-P-0216, Lipid-Q-P-0034, Lipid-Q-P-0800), which would collectively benefit the clinical diagnosis of MAFLD and T2DM.},

abstract = {Purpose. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been extensively studied for its preventive and treatment properties toward osteoporosis (OP). Pharmacological studies have shown that TCM Eclipta prostrata induce anti-OP effects. Considering the growing evidence demonstrating that gut microbiota (GM) is related to OP, we aimed to study the GM-dependent function and mechanism of E. prostrata for preventing OP in mice. Methodology. Bone micro-structure was obtained using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and bone-relating factors were detected by molecular biological test. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region was performed for GM diversity analysis. Growth effects of E. prostrata on potential targeted strains Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were investigated by in vitro bacterial assay. By feeding Lactobacillus and Lactococcus in mice, GM and bone condition were analysed. Results. Bone micro-structure was significantly improved by E. prostrata with a potential mechanism of inhibiting osteoclast, increasing the number of osteoblasts and regulating the dynamic balance of bone absorption and formation. Sequencing results indicated that E. prostrata altered the bacterial community. The abundance of bacteria genera Lactobacillus and Lactococcus was markedly decreased in individuals with OP and positively correlated with high dose of E. prostrata. GM of the low-dose E. prostrata-fed group did not significantly differ from that of the chow-fed OP group, which was consistent with bone structure test results. Moreover, E. prostrata could promote Lactobacillus and Lactococcus growth in vitro. GM was altered and bone condition was improved via bacterial feeding in vivo. Conclusion. Our findings suggested that E. prostrata might be a novel therapy for OP prevention by targeting GM.},

We have also evaluated its effect on different in vivo toxicity parameters. Here, we found that AEEA was found to be most active in most of the cancer cell lines but it significantly induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cell lines by disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA damage. Moreover, AEEA treatment inhibited migration in both MCF 7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose dependent manner. Further, AEEA possesses robust in vitro antioxidant activity along with high total phenolic and flavonoid contents. In summary, our results indicate that Eclipta alba has enormous potential in complementary and alternative medicine for the treatment of cancer.},

Appropriate animal models are vital to test the mechanism and pathophysiology of ALI and investigate different hepatoprotective strategies.

CCl 4 exposure can be performed intraperitoneally, by inhalation, or through a nasogastric or orogastric tube. Here, we describe a rodent model, in which ALI is induced by CCl 4 exposure through an orogastric tube. This method is inexpensive, easily performed, and has minimal hazard risk.

In the course of screening antifibrotic activity of natural products employing HSC-T6, a rat hepatic stellate cell line as an in vitro assay system, the methanolic extract of aerial parts of Eclipta prostrata L. showed significant inhibitory activity on HSCs proliferation. Activity-guided fractionation led to the isolation of five oleanane-type triterpenoids, echinocystic acid (1), eclalbasaponin II (2), eclalbasaponin V (3), eclalbasaponin I (4) and eclalbasaponin III (5), which are all echinocystic acid derivatives. Among the five echinocystic acid derivatives isolated, echinocystic acid (1) and eclalbasaponin II (2) significantly inhibited the proliferation of HSCs in dose- and time-dependent manners. Our present study also suggests the importance of free carboxylic acid at C-28 position in echinocystic acid derivatives for the antifibrotic activity.

The current study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the methanol extract of Eclipta prostrata (E. prostrata) in rats using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) followed by multivariate and univariate data analysis. Phytochemical study of E. prostrata extract was performed using chemical, colorimetric, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Forty-two Wistar albino rats divided into seven groups (six in each) were used in this study. Fatty liver was induced in rats using a high-fat diet together with cholesterol and cholic acid, then they were treated with different doses of E. prostrata. The histopathological examination of liver and NAFLD activity score showed significant markers for the diagnosis of the early stage of the disease. Treatment with high doses of E. prostrata (300 and 200 mg/kg BW) extract exhibited significant improvement in liver function and lipid profile in rats bearing NAFLD. Lipidomic analysis showed a discrete variability in the levels of some metabolites, including cholest-5-en-3-ol (3$\beta$)-acetate; cholesta-4, 6-dien-3-ol, (3$\beta$); urea; 1,3 dipalmitin; glycerol; linoleic acid; and arachidonic acid in sera of rats bearing NAFLD in contrast to healthy ones. Treatment with E. prostrata extract showed noticeable amelioration in the levels of these metabolites. The present results concluded that E. prostrata in high doses (300 and 200 mg/kg BW) had the potential efficacy to ameliorate NAFLD. Nevertheless, lipidomics could be used for the early detection of NAFLD and in the assessment of the mechanism of herbal medications.},

Results: CCl 4 and olive oil mixture (1:1 dosage of 1 mL/kg b.w.) induced oxidative stress was indicated by elevated levels of TBARS and hydroperoxides, and augmented levels of serum AST, ALT and ALP. The depleted activity levels of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT, GPX and GST were found in CCl 4 induced animals. The aqueous leaf extract of E. alba (250 mg/kg b.w.) ameliorated the effects of CCl 4 and returned the alter levels of the biochemical markers near to the normal levels. Conclusions: The study indicates that aqueous leaf extract of E. alba has potential restorative effect on CCl 4 induced hepatotoxicity in male albino rats. {\textcopyright} 2011 Asian Pacific Tropical Medicine Press.},

abstract = {Hepatitis C virus has a major role in spreading chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Factors such as high costs, pharmacological side effects, and the development of drug resistance strains require the development of new and potentially effective antiviral to treat the various stages of Hepatitis C. Bioactive chemicals have been extracted from medicinal plants and are utilized by humans for the goal of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The goal of this work is to recognize phytochemicals from Eclipta alba and assess their potentiality activity against the hepatitis C virus envelope glycoprotein using in silico approaches. Phytochemicals from Eclipta alba were virtually screened by Auto dock raccoon and 12 compounds were selected for molecular docking to probe the active binding site. The top two compounds based on the binding score like ecliptalbine and oleanolic acid with HCV E2 glycoprotein exhibit binding energy −8.88 and −8.02 kcal/mol, respectively. The chemicals' usefulness was reinforced by positive pharmacokinetic data. The phytocompounds were identified as potent HCV inhibitors based on the drug likeness and ADMET properties. Both ecliptalbine and oleanolic acid underwent molecular dynamics simulations to determine features such as RMSD, RMSF, SASA, hydrogen-bond number, and MM-PBSA-based binding free energy. From the molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation study revealed that oleanolic acid obtained from Eclipta alba can be used as inhibitors against Hepatitis C. The identified inhibitor from our study will be study in vitro and in vivo studies to check their efficacy against Hepatitis C. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.},

Ethnobotanical data was collected from a remote rural area of Mandi Ahmad Abad, Union council number NA-144 Tehsil Depalpur District Okara, Pakistan. A total of 94 informants were randomly interviewed to collect data about local names of plant species, mode of administration, recipes and ailments, and ethnobotanical uses through semi-structured questionnaire, interviews and group discussion methods. The collected data was statistically analyzed by calculating use value (UV), frequency of citation (FC), relative frequency of citation (RFC), factor of informant consensus (FIC), family importance value, and relative importance (RI). This study is also compared with ethnobotanical literature by using Jaccard's index (JI) for similarity analysis. A total of 126 species belonging to 52 families were documented. The Poaceae (13spp.), Leguminosae (12spp.), Solanaceae (10spp.) and Cucurbitaceae (10spp.) were dominant families. Highest used value (UV = 0.22) was obtained for Azadirachta indica. The minimum used value (UV) was showed by Alhagi maurorum, Eclipta prostrata, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Solanum virginianum and Trianthema potulacastrum (UV = 0.01). Hepatitis, stomach ulcer, bowel disorders, urinary problems, psoriasis, cancer, and leucoderma were the most treated ailments with ICF value of 1, followed by leucorrhea (ICF: 0.89), and vomiting (ICF: 0.86). The highest Jaccard's similarity index value (JI = 0.329) showed that plant species reported in our study was more similar with Arid regions of Northern Punjab, Pakistan. This novel ethnobotanical report concluded that traditional knowledge about use of medicinal plants is decreasing due to allopathic medicines. Immediate steps should be taken for conservation and documentation of traditional knowledge of plants especially those having medicinal properties.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Erythrina mulungu Benth. (“mulungu”, Fabaceae) is a Brazilian native species with ethnopharmacological use for respiratory diseases. However, the effects of E. mulungu on the respiratory were never studied. Aims of the study: To evaluate the effects of an ethanolic extract from flowers of E. mulungu in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma in mice, and to study the mechanisms involved. Materials and methods: OVA-sensitized mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) treated with four doses (200, 400, 600, and 800 mg/kg) of the E. mulungu extract or dexamethasone (DEXA, 2 mg/kg) during seven consecutive days and simultaneously challenged with intranasal OVA. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was evaluated in vivo, 24 h after the last OVA challenge. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was collected for counting the number of total and differential inflammatory cells. Blood was collected for measurement of anti-OVA IgE levels. Levels of cytokines interleukin (IL)− 4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and interferon (INF)-$\gamma$ were measured in pulmonary homogenate by ELISA. The recruitment of inflammatory cells to the lung tissue was determined using hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E). The extract's chromatographic profile was evaluated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Results: The treatment with E. mulungu extract significantly reduced bronchial hyperresponsiveness, significantly reduced the number of leukocytes, eosinophils, and lymphocytes in BAL, and significantly decreased the levels of IL-4 and IL-5, while increased levels of IL-13 and INF-$\gamma$. In addition, E. mulungu significantly decreased the cellular inflammatory infiltration in the lung tissue. Erysotrine, erysotrine-N-oxide, and hypaphorine were the major constituents identified in the extract. Conclusion: Collectively, these results confirm the potential of E. mulungu for asthma treatment, through modulation of inflammatory response, supporting its ethnopharmacological use for respiratory diseases.},

We aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of C. longa in renal injury induced by doxorubicin (DOX, 3.5 mg.kg−1 IV). We studied four groups of Wistar rats: two groups with DOX-induced kidney injury, one fed with standard food and another with standard food mixed with C. longa (5 mg.g−1). Two other control groups without kidney injury were fed with the same foods. We measured albuminuria, body weight, and food intake every 2 weeks. After 8 weeks, treatment with C. longa did not change albuminuria, but it significantly attenuated the excretion of urinary inflammatory markers monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) and significantly attenuated immunostaining for desmin, vimentin, and ED-1+ cells in renal tissues of rats with DOX-induced kidney injury. In addition, treatment with C. longa resulted in significantly lower glomerular and tubule interstitial injury scores, compared with that in the DOX-STD group. In conclusion, administration of powdered rhizomes of C. longa for 8 weeks to rats with DOX-induced kidney injury did not reduce albuminuria but led to a significant decrease in urinary inflammatory markers MCP-1 and TGF-$\beta$ and decreased histopathological alterations and immunostaining for desmin, vimentin, and ED-1+ cells kidneys tissues.},

This activity was confirmed in preclinical studies. However, its efficacy was never studied in human clinical trials. Aim of the study: We aimed to test the hypothesis that the herbal medicine of A. polystachya is superior to placebo for the treatment of anxiety-related symptoms in adults after 8 weeks. Patients and methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase-2 clinical trial. Fifty-four adults with self-reported anxiety symptoms were randomly allocated to receive either capsules containing A. polystachya powdered leaves (300 mg, twice a day) or placebo (maltodextrin), for 8 weeks. The intensity of anxiety symptoms was assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Ranking Scale (HAM-A) at baseline and after 2, 4 and 8 weeks. All analyses were adjusted for physical activity (assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire [IPAQ], short version) and gender. Results: We confirmed the presence of acteoside (chromatographic analysis) and carvone and limonene (gas chromatography) as major constituents in our plant material. Only patients that received A. polystachya experienced a significant decrease in their HAM-A scores, with none or mild side-effects. Conclusion: Administration of powdered leaves of A. polystachya, rich in acteoside, carvone and limonene, to adults with anxiety symptoms was significantly superior to placebo in decreasing HAM-A scores after 8 weeks.

We also studied the chemical composition of its essential oil by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: We described for the first time a particular L. alba chemotype with geranial and carvenone as major compounds. With treatment, both frequency and intensity of pain episodes significantly decreased from baseline to first reassessment date. More than 80% of patients experienced a minimum 50% reduction on pain intensity and frequency. No side effects were reported. Conclusions: Treatment with a geranial plus carvenone chemotype of L. alba hydro-alcoholic extract is a cheap, widely available, highly effective therapy to reduce both the intensity and the frequency of headache episodes of migraine patients with no side effects. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Uncaria tomentosa (Willd. Ex Schult) DC is used by indigenous tribes in the Amazonian region of Central and South America to treat inflammation, allergies and asthma. The therapeutic properties of U. tomentosa have been attributed to the presence of tetracyclic and pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids and to phenolic acids. Aims of the study: To characterize aqueous bark extracts (ABE) and aqueous leaf extracts (ALE) of U. tomentosa and to compare their anti-inflammatory effects. Materials and methods: Constituents of the extracts were identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Anti-inflammatory activities were assessed in vitro by exposing lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage cells (RAW264.7-Luc) to ABE, ALE and standard mitraphylline. In vivo assays were performed using a murine model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma. OVA-sensitized animals were treated with ABE or ALE while controls received dexamethasone or saline solution. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness, production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines, total and differential counts of inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissue were determined. Results: Mitraphylline, isomitraphylline, chlorogenic acid and quinic acid were detected in both extracts, while isorhyncophylline and rutin were detected only in ALE. ABE, ALE and mitraphylline inhibited the transcription of nuclear factor kappa-B in cell cultures, ALE and mitraphylline reduced the production of interleukin (IL)−6, and mitraphylline reduced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Treatment with ABE and ALE at 50 and 200 mg kg−1, respectively, reduced respiratory elastance and tissue damping and elastance. ABE and ALE reduced the number of eosinophils in BAL, while ALE at 200 mg kg−1 reduced the levels of IL-4 and IL-5 in the lung homogenate. Peribronchial inflammation was significantly reduced by treatment with ABE and ALE at 50 and 100 mg kg−1 respectively. Conclusion: The results clarify for the first time the anti-inflammatory activity of U. tomentosa in a murine model of asthma. Although ABE and ALE exhibited distinct chemical compositions, both extracts inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. In vivo assays revealed that ABE was more effective in treating asthmatic inflammation while ALE was more successful in controlling respiratory mechanics. Both extracts may have promising applications in the phytotherapy of allergic asthma.},

abstract = {Objective:Pyrostegia venusta (Ker-Gawl.) Miers (Bignoniaceae) is a perennial invasive vine, distributed worldwide. In folk medicine, its parts are used for the treatment of inflammatory respiratory diseases. Extracts of P. venusta have antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antinociceptive properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two extracts (aqueous and hydroethanolic) of P. venusta in the treatment of asthma in an animal model. Methods: Balb/c mice were sensitized twice with ovalbumin (OVA) intraperitoneally (ip), one week apart, and after one week, challenged with OVA intranasally on four alternate days. Mice were treated ip with 300 mg/kg of aqueous or hydroethanolic extracts for seven consecutive days. Control groups received saline on the same days. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness, production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines, lung and airway inflammation, and antioxidant activity in lung tissue were assessed. Results: Treatment with aqueous extract significantly decreased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, measured by total and tissue resistance and elastance. The administration of hydroethanolic extract did not reduce bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In addition, both extracts significantly reduced total cell and eosinophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage. Both extracts did not change significantly IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, IFN-gamma, and TGF-beta levels. Of note, only the aqueous extract significantly increased the total antioxidant activity and reduced lung inflammation. Conclusion: Aqueous extract of P. venusta reduced bronchial hyperresponsiveness, lung and airway inflammation, probably via an antioxidant mechanism. These results demonstrate that P. venusta may have potential for asthma treatment.},

It is widely distributed throughout India, China, Thailand, and Brazil. The herb has been known for its curative properties and has been utilized as antimytotoxic, analgesic, antibacterial, antihepatotoxic, antihaemorrhagic, antihyperglycemic, antioxidant, immunomodulatory properties and it is considered as a good rejuvenator too. Recent studies showed an antivenom property & corrosion pickling inhibitor action on mild steel in hydrochloric acid. A wide range of chemical compounds including coumestans, alkaloids, thiopenes, flavonoids, polyacetylenes, triterpenes and their glycosides have been isolated from this species. This contribution provides an comprehensive review on ethnomedicinal uses, chemical composition, and the antidiabetic property as medicinal plant. Oral administration of leaf suspension of E. alba (2 and 4 g/kg body weight) for 60 days results in significant reduction in blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin HbA(l)c. The extract decreases the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and increase the activity of liver hexokinase. Thus, oral administration of E. alba possess potent antihyperglycemic activity [1].},

abstract = {Background: Hypertension is an immensely pervaded problem in today's population and is a unanimous major risk factor for heart diseases. Various natural herbs have been found to control the hypertension exquisitely without causing any significant adverse effect. Eclipta alba (EA) and Boerhaavia diffusa (BD) are two herbaceous plants. EA is used to treat hepatic-dysfunction, hair diseases and anemia since ancient time. Similarly, BD is a great treatment-option for renal and urinary disorders. They have also been found quite effective in the safe treatment of hypertension. But studies in this respect are very scanty and confirmatory role of these herbs in hypertension is yet to be established. In the present study, effects of EA and BD on normal blood pressure (NBP) and hypertension were studied. Their antihypertensive activities were also compared with those of Amlodipine (Amlo). Method(s): Adult Wistar rats of both sexes, weighing 140-150 g were randomized equally to make 9 groups (6 rats/ group). First 6 groups were given high fat diet for 49 days to produce hypertension. Then drugs were given for next 45 days without stopping high fat diet. 7th, 8th & 9th groups were meant to see the effects of EA and BD on NBP; they were kept on normal diet and were given EA-200 mg/kg, BD-200 mg/kg, EA+BD (200 mg/kg of each) respectively for first 45 days. SBP (systolic blood pressure) was measured by 'Tail-cuff method' with the help of NIBP (non-invasive blood pressure measurement)-controller machine. Result(s): All drugs showed significant antihypertensive activities. Rats on Amlo-10 mg/kg showed most significant reduction (39.54%), followed by rats on EA+BD (200mg/kg of each; 31.01% reduction), BD-200 mg/kg (28.91% reduction), EA-200 mg/kg (25.54% reduction), BD-100 mg/kg (20.68% reduction). EA, BD and EA+BD caused no significant reduction in NBP. Conclusion(s): To conclude, EA and BD comprise significant antihypertensive activities with no harmful effects on (reduction in) NBP.},

This figure is self explanatory for its alarming growth and concern to be given for its prevention and management. It is erroneous to treat it as a disease rather it should be treated as a syndrome, because rarely it is presented in its discrete form i.e. only hyperglycemia as a clinical feature. Being a metabolic disease it is almost always accompanied with many other diseases like hypothyroidism, hypertension, fatty liver disease, obesity, dyslipidemia, etc. According to the known pathophysiology of diabetes, hyperglycemia is said to be responsible for dyslipidemia, constant high sugar level in blood produces dreaded effect at micro as well as macro- vascular level. This established pathology of the disease revolves around high glucose level in blood and make it the diagnostic parameter for diabetes. Although the cause of hyperglycemia are also well defined but there is one missing link which is totally neglected by the modern science i.e., role of liver in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Do any way hampered liver functions affect insulin production or its utilization by the cell- the question that required answer. This clinical trial is based on materializing the concept that effective bile secretion improves insulin activity.

abstract = {Plant drugs are known to play a major role in the management of liver diseases. There are many plants and their extracts that have been shown to possess hepatoprotective activities. There are more than 300 preparations in Indian system of medicine for the treatment of jaundice and chronic liver diseases. About 600 commercial herbal formulations with claimed hepatoprotective activity are being sold all over the globe. The active phytochemical fraction that imparts hepatoprotective activity has been identified in many plants. These phytochemicals can be isolated and developed as single-ingredient drugs, with quality and standards of modern medicine. The major problem faced with herbal products is their standardization and their quality assurance. There can be batch-to-batch variations in their efficacies as a result of natural and genetic alterations, seasonal changes, differences in soil and climatic conditions, and nutritional status of the medicinal plant. Pharmacological validation of each hepatoprotective plant should include efficacy evaluation against liver diseases induced by various agents. The most effective drugs for each kind of liver disease have to be selected by separate efficacy evaluations. To treat liver disease of known, unknown, or multiple causes, a combination of different herbs with active fractions (or purified compounds) has to be developed. They may prove to be useful in the treatment of infective, toxic, and degenerative diseases of the liver. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Fundamental and Clinical Pharmacology {\textcopyright} 2011 Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} Fran{\c{c}}aise de Pharmacologie et de Th{\'{e}}rapeutique.},

abstract = {Snakebite envenoming is a potentially fatal disease categorized as a neglected public health issue for not receiving the appropriate attention from national and international health authorities. The most affected people by this problem usually live in poor rural communities, where medical resources are often sparse and, in some instances, there is even a scarcity of serum therapy. The administration of the appropriate antivenom is the only specific treatment available, however it has limited efficacy against venom-induced local effects. In this scenario, various plant species are used as local first aid for the treatment of snakebite accidents in Brazil, and some of them can effectively inhibit lethality, neurotoxicity, hemorrhage, and venom enzymes activities. This review compiles a list of plants used in the treatment of snakebites in Brazil, focusing on the native Brazilian species registered in the databases Pubmed, Scielo, Scopus and Google Scholar. All these searches were limited to peer-reviewed journals written in English, with the exception of a few articles written in Portuguese. The most cited native plant species were Casearia sylvestris Sw., Eclipta prostrata (L.) L., Mikania glomerata Spreng., Schizolobium parahyba (Vell.) S.F.Blake and Dipteryx alata Vogel, all used to decrease the severity of toxic signs, inhibit proteolytic and hemorrhagic activities, thus increasing survival time and neutralizing myotoxicity effects. Different active compounds showing important activity against the snake venoms and their toxins include flavonoids, alkaloids and tannins. Although some limitations to the experimental studies with medicinal plants were observed, including lack of comparison with control drugs and unknown active extracts compounds, species with anti-venom characteristics are effective and considered as candidates for the development of adjuvants in the treatment of snake envenomation. Further studies on the chemistry and pharmacology of traditionally used plant species will help to understand the role that snakebite herbal remedies may display in local medical health systems. It might also contribute to the development of alternative or complementary treatments to reduce the number of severe disabilities and deaths.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Information regarding the use of beneficial, native Brazilian plants was compiled by European naturalists during the 19th century. The German botanist C.F.P. von Martius was one of the most prominent naturalists and described the use of several Brazilian plants. Aim of the study: To present data on Amazonian medicinal plants documented by von Martius in his books. Materials and methods: Data on Amazonian medicinal plants were obtained from three books published by von Martius. Traditional information about these plants was translated from Latin and the cited plant species reorganised according to current taxonomic criteria. Correlated pharmacological studies were obtained from different scientific databases. Results: A total of 92 native medicinal species from the Amazon were recorded in von Martius' books. These accounts described 117 different medical uses for these plants. Several parts of the plants were used, including many exudates. The principal use of the species recorded was the treatment of dermatological problems, followed by gastro-intestinal, urinary and respiratory disorders. Few species were recorded as purgatives and febrifuges, a result that differs from the observations of other naturalists. The efficacy of the recorded traditional uses has been confirmed for the few species that have been subjected to laboratory studies. Conclusion: The data recorded by the German naturalist von Martius represent a rich, unexplored source of information about the traditional uses of Brazilian plants. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Jaundice is not a disease but it is a visible sign and symptom of liver disease which occurs when there is an increase in the amount of bilirubin circulating in the blood due to the abnormal metabolism and excretion in the urine. Medicinal plants are being used long ago by our ancestors for the treatment of jaundice. At the present era, consumption of these herbal medicines is increasing at a high speed, due to its less or no side effect and cost-effectiveness as compared to synthetic medicines. This review describes approximately 55 medicinal plants which are used by rural and tribal people of different area of Chhattisgarh for curing jaundice. The data was collected from different kinds of literature survey from the year 1993 to 2018. This review has been conferred in a systematic way which includes plant's vernacular name, botanical name along with its family, part used and ethnomedicinal uses in a tabulated form and also the description of scientific evidence behind the folklore uses of some medicinal plants along with their mechanism of action which have been reported in different kinds of literature.

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Inspite of tremendous advances made in allopathic medical practices, herbs still play an important role in the management of various liver diseases. A large number of plants and formulations have been claimed to have hepatoprotective activity. Jaundice is a symptom, indicative of the malfunctioning of the liver. This paper provides ethnomedicinal information on the plants used to treat jaundice by three important indigenous communities, i.e.; nomadic Gujjars, Tharu and Bhoxa of Sub-Himalayan region, Uttarakhand, India. Aims of the study: To record herbal preparations used by the studied indigenous communities in treatment of jaundice and discuss hepatoprotective properties of the recorded plants. Research strategy and methods: The traditional knowledge of the studied indigenous communities on herbal preparations used for treating jaundice was collected through structured questionnaire and personal interviews. The interviews were conducted with 91 traditional healers (29 Bhoxa, 35 Tharu and 27 nomadic Gujjars) in Sub-Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India. More than 250 research papers reporting ethnomedicinal information on the hepatoprotective plants used by various communities from different parts of India were extensively reviewed. Results: A total of 40 medicinal plants belonging to 31 families and 38 genera were recorded to be used by the studied communities in 45 formulations as a remedy of jaundice. Bhoxa, nomadic Gujjars and Tharu communities used 15, 23 and 9 plants, respectively. To our knowledge eight plants reported in the present survey viz.; Amaranthus spinosus L.; Cissampelos pareira L.; Ehretia laevis Roxb.; Holarrhena pubescens Wall.; Ocimum americanum L.; Physalis divaricata D. Don, Solanum incanum L. and Trichosanthes cucumerina L. have not been reported earlier as remedy of jaundice in India. Literature review revealed that a total of 214 (belonging to 181 genus and 78 families), 19 (belonging to 18 genus and 12 families) and 14 (belonging to 14 genus and 11 families) plant species are used as internal, external and magico-religious remedies for jaundice, respectively by various communities in different parts of India. Most widely used hepatoprotective plant species for treatment of jaundice in India is Boerhavia diffusa L. followed by Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers, Saccharum officinarum L.; Phyllanthus amarus Schumach. & Thonn.; Ricinus communis L.; Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees.; Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz, Lawsonia inermis L. and Eclipta prostrata (L.) L. Conclusions: The plants recorded in the present survey have also been discussed in relation to pharmacological studies and hepatoprotective phytoconstituents present in them. Most of the recorded plants have shown hepatoprotective effects on experimental animals in earlier studies but more studies are needed to assess hepatoprotective properties of some recorded medicinal plants viz.; Averrhoa carambola L.; Ehretia laevis Roxb.; Holarrhena pubescens Wall.; Mangifera indica L.; Ocimum americanum L.; Oroxylum indicum (L.) Kurz, Physalis divaricata D. Don, Solanum incanum L.; Sphaeranthus senegalensis DC. and Tribulus terrestris L. The plants enumerated in this study with high number of citations and wider distributions have given some useful leads for further biomedical research. Nevertheless more phytochemical, pharmaceutical and clinical studies are needed to evaluate hepatoprotective properties, efficacy and safety of all the claimed medicinal plants. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Eclipta prostrata, a traditional herbal medicine, has long been used in Asia and South America for the therapy of hemorrhagic diseases (e.g. hemoptysis, hematemesis, hematuria, epistaxis and uterine bleeding), skin diseases, respiratory disorders, coronary heart disease, hair loss, vitiligo, snake bite and those caused by the deficiency of liver and kidney. Aim of the review: In this review, we highlight relatively comprehensive and up-to-date information of E. prostrata on traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicity, along with featuring the gaps in current knowledge, aiming to provide references for future research and possible opportunities for well applications of this medicinal plant. Materials and methods: Information on E. prostrata was gathered from scientific databases (Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scifinder, Baidu Scholar, PubMed and CNKI). Information was also obtained from local books, Ph.D. theses and M.Sc. dissertations and Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The plant taxonomy was validated by the database “The Plant List”. Results: Various phytochemical classes has been identified and isolated from the plant covering triterpenes, flavonoids, thiopenes, coumestans, steroids and others. Among these, coumestans are reported as the most common ingredients. The isolated crude extracts and individual compounds have been reported to exhibit promising pharmacological properties, such as hepatoprotective, osteoprotective, cytotoxic, hypoglycaemic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, hypolipidemic, promoting hair growth, rejuvenative and neuroprotective effects. Conclusions: Until now, significant progress has been witnessed in phytochemistry and pharmacology of E. prostrata. Thus, some traditional uses has been well supported and clarified by modern pharmacological studies. Moreover, E. prostrata also showed therapeutic potential in some refractory diseases such as cancer, dementia and diabetes. But, present findings are still insufficient that cannot satisfactorily explain some mechanisms of action. More well-designed studies in vitro especially in vivo are required to establish links between the traditional uses and bioactivities, discover new skeletons and activity molecules, as well as ensure safety before clinical use.},

abstract = {Background: Atherosclerosis is the major cause of morbidities and mortalities worldwide. In this study we aimed to review the mechanism of atherosclerosis and its risk factors, focusing on new findings in atherosclerosis markers and its risk factors. Furthermore, the role of antioxidants and medicinal herbs in atherosclerosis and endothelial damage has been discussed and a list of important medicinal plants effective in the treatment and prevention of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis is presented. Methods: The recently published papers about atherosclerosis pathogenesis and herbal medicines effective in the treatment and prevention of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis were searched. Results: Inflammation has a crucial role in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The disease is accompanied by excessive fibrosis of the intima, fatty plaques formation, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and migration of a group of cells such as monocytes, T cells, and platelets which are formed in response to inflammation. The oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) to Ox-LDL indicates the first step of atherosclerosis in cardiovascular diseases. Malondialdehyde factor shows the level of lipoperoxidation and is a sign of increased oxidative pressure and cardiovascular diseases. In special pathological conditions such as severe hypercholesterolemia, peroxynitrite concentration increases and atherosclerosis and vascular damage are intensified. Medicinal plants have shown to be capable of interacting these or other pathogenesis factors to prevent atherosclerosis. Conclusions: The pathogenesis factors involved in atherosclerosis have recently been cleared and the discovery of these factors has brought about new hopes for better prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.},

abstract = {A swift increase has been observed in the number of individuals with metabolic syndrome worldwide. A number of natural compounds have been identified towards combating metabolic syndrome. Adding to this premise, here we report the pleiotropic activities of Ecliptal (EC); a natural compound isolated from the herb Eclipta alba. Administration of EC was shown to have prominent anti-adipogenic effects in 3T3-L1 and hMSC derived adipocytes. It was shown to activate Wnt-pathway and alter AKT signaling. Additionally, it caused cell cycle arrest and inhibited mitotic clonal expansion. EC treatment augmented mitochondrial biogenesis as well as function as estimated by expression of PGC1$\alpha$, UCP-1, mitochondrial complexes and estimation of oxygen consumption rate. EC also reduced LPS-induced inflammation and tunicamycin induced ER stress. Further, EC enhanced insulin sensitivity by increasing AKT phosphorylation, inhibiting PKC$\alpha$/$\beta$II phosphorylation and reducing leptin/adiponectin ratio. Finally, EC administration in Syrian golden hamsters was shown to have potent anti-dyslipidemic effects. Cumulatively, encompassing pleiotropic activities of EC, it could prove to be a potential drug candidate against obesity, insulin resistance and related metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {Parkinsonism is an age-associated neurodegenerative disorder characterized by aggregation of $\alpha$-synuclein ($\alpha$-syn) protein in the substantia nigra region, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and deregulated lipid metabolism. Currently, only symptomatic relief has been provided by FDA-approved therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aims to evaluate the potential of wedelolactone (WDL), a natural occurring coumestan found in Eclipta alba to mitigate the parkinsonism in Caenorhabditis elegans disease model. In the present studies, supplementation with 37.5 $\mu$M WDL exhibited a reduction in the level of $\alpha$-syn in an age-dependent manner (22% at day 5, p < 0.05; and 16% at day 10, p < 0.001, n = 30), along with improvement in neuronal health through basal movement, and elevated the dopamine levels evident through 1-nonanol repulsion results in wild-type and diseased worms. Moreover, WDL augmented the mitochondrial health in wild-type, PD-diseased, and mev-1 mutant worms that establish the inherent activity of WDL in the alleviation of oxidative stress. Furthermore, WDL supplementation significantly decreases the neutral lipid and triglyceride level and also alleviates protein carbonyl level in PD disease condition. The overall investigation will provide a pioneer to the future insights of PD research related to plant-based drugs. qPCR studies after WDL supplementation revealed alteration of genes involved in the regulation of various stress-responsive (sod-5, gst-4, skn-1), $\alpha$-syn-suppressing (lrk-1, ymel-1, lagr-1, grk-1), and mitochondrial (pink-1) genes. All together, these findings support that the WDL is a promising candidate to combat age-related multi-factorial PD pathology associated with protein misfolding and accumulation. The results provide sufficient information in the development of therapeutic medicines from natural products for improving the health.},

abstract = {Chronic stress is a risk factor for the development of many psychopathological conditions in humans, including major depression and anxiety disorders and cognitive dysfunction. It is therefore important to focus on identifying possible mechanism to prevent these stress-induced disorders. Therefore, current study was designed to investigate the effect of Eclipta alba on chronic unpredicted stress (CUS) induced behavioral dysfunction, oxidative stress and neurotransmitter levels in the discrete regions of rat brain. Animals were subjected to acute and chronic unpredictable stress for 30 days, and the effect of Eclipta alba was studied in acute and chronic stressed animals during which 200 mg/kg Eclipta alba was administered orally. Our Results revealed that stressed animals performed poorly in Novel object recognition task (NORT). Eclipta alba alleviated behavioral dysfunction in chronically stressed animals and also significantly increased antioxidant levels such as SOD, Catalase, total thiol and decreased oxidative stress markers such MDA, nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide in discrete brain regions as compared to CUS. Further increased catecholamine and decreased 5HT due to chronic stress in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and corpus stiatum was normalized with the treatment of Eclipta alba. In conclusion, Eclipta alba can efficiently prevent stress induced neurological complications by its antioxidant and efficiently regulating altered neurotransmitters and preventing DNA Damage.},

abstract = {The rising burden of herbal and dietary supplement hepatotoxicity (HILI) is a growing concern in Western countries. The estimated incidence of HILI in well-designed prospective studies ranges from less than 1 to 3 individuals per 100,000 inhabitants/year. Herbal hepatotoxicity has a particular signature encompassing female predominance, hepatocellular type of damage with markedly elevated transaminases on presentation, more common unintentional rechallenge, and a greater risk of death/liver transplantation. Herbal hepatotoxicity recognition is particularly challenging for hepatologists because of the often hidden herbal consumption, difficulties in identifying the causative herbal component, and the possibility of contamination, adulteration, and misidentification, which preclude a proper adjudication and lead to inaccurate reporting of cases in scientific journals. Collaborative efforts to retrieve detailed phenotypic data and biological samples of patients with HILI would facilitate genomic and other molecular approaches for a better understanding of host risk factors and, hopefully, for biomarker identification.},

abstract = {Objective: To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of SIX Traditional Chinese Patent Medicines (TCPM) recommended by guidelines in improving lipids for patients with prediabetes by network meta-analysis. Methods: Randomized controlled trials of 6 TCPM in the treatment of prediabetes were searched systematically in various databases. After extracting effective data, the risk of bias was assessed using Review Manager 5.3 and Cochrane Collaboration Systems Evaluator's Manual. Network meta-analysis was performed using STATA 15.0 based on the frequency statistical model. The effect size and credibility of the evidence for the intervention were summarized based on a minimal contextualized framework. Results: A total of 27 studies involving 2,227 patients were included. Compared with lifestyle modification (LM), Shenqi + LM [SMD −0.49 (95% CI: −0.85, −0.12)] and Jinqi + LM [SMD −0.44 (95% CI: −0.81, −0.06)] showed statistically significant effect in lowering TG, Shenqi + LM [SMD −0.51 (95%CI: −0.86, −0.17)] and Jinqi + LM [SMD −0.44 (95%CI: −0.80, −0.08)] in lowering TC, Jinlida + LM [SMD −0.31 (95%CI: −0.59, −0.04)] in lowering LDL-C, Shenqi + LM [SMD 0.29 (95%CI: 0.06, 0.51)] and Jinqi + LM [SMD 0.16 (95%CI: 0.01, 0.31)] in increasing HDL-C. Conclusion: For patients with prediabetes, Traditional Chinese patent medicine Jinqi and Shenqi combined with lifestyle modification were associated with a significant reduction in TG and TC, while Shenqi + LM was among the most effective. Jinlida + LM was among the least effective. Systematic Review Registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier PROSPERO(CRD42021279332).},

abstract = {The present study was designed to investigate the antioxidant, analgesic and anti-inflammatory potential of the methanolic extract along with its organic soluble fractions of the herb Eclipta prostrata. In addition, total phenolic and flavonoid content and total antioxidant capacity were also determined. Antioxidant potential of the extract/fractions was evaluated by DPPH (1,1diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), NO (nitric oxide) and ONOO- (peroxynitrite) scavenging assay method. Ethyl acetate fractions (EtOAc) showed highest scavenging activity in all the methods with IC50 value of 12.98±0.08, 45.98±0.07 and 14.45±0.18 $\mu$g mL-1 for DPPH, NO and ONOO- assay method, respectively. In reducing power assay, EtOAc fraction also showed significant (p<0.001) activity. Further, the extract/fractions were studied for their analgesic (hot plate, tail immersion and acetic acid induced writhing test) and anti-inflammatory (carrageenan induced paw edema in rats) activities at a dose level of 200 and 400 mg kg-1 body weight. Among all the extract/fractions, EtOAc fraction showed a dose dependent and significant (p<0.005, p<0.05) analgesic activity in all the tested method. EtOAc fractions also reduced the paw edema considerably (86.80% inhibition after 3 h, p<0.005, p<0.05) in dose dependent manner compared to carrageenan induced rat. Altogether, these results suggest that the MeOH extract and its organic soluble fractions could be used as a potential antioxidant, analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent {\textcopyright} 2011 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract = {Cognitive impairment, associated with ageing, stress, hypertension and various neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, is a major health issue. The present review focuses on Alzheimer's disease (AD), since it is the most important cause of cognitive impairment. It is characterized by progressive memory loss, language deficits, depression, agitation, mood disturbances and psychosis. Although the hallmarks of AD are cholinergic dysfunction, $\beta$-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle formation, it is also associated with derangement of other neurotransmitters, elevated levels of advanced glycation end products, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, genetic and environmental factors. On one hand, this complex etiopathology makes a response to commonly used drugs such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine less predictable and often unsatisfactory. On the other hand, it supports the use of herbal medicines due to their nonspecific antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and specific cholinesterase inhibitory activity. The popularity of herbal medicines is also increasing due to their perceived effectiveness, safety and affordability. In the present article, the experimental and clinical evidence have been reviewed for various Indian herbal medicines such as Centella asiatica, Bacopa monnieri, Curcuma longa, Clitoria ternatea, Withania somnifera, Celastrus paniculatus, Evolvulus alsinoides, Desmodium gangeticum, Eclipta alba, Moringa oleifera and Convolvulus pluricaulis, which have shown potential in cognitive impairment.

abstract = {The combined effect of dried Eclipta alba leaf powder (3 g/day) in encapsulated form on blood pressure, diuresis, and lipid profile of 60 mildly hypertensive male subjects in the age group of 40-55 years was studied. The subjects were divided into two groups, i.e., a control (placebo) and the Eclipta group, and were given six capsules (500 mg each) per day in three equal doses for a period of 60 days. Clinical parameters, viz., blood pressure, urine volume, electrolytes (Na and K) in serum and urine, lipid profile, and plasma lipid peroxides, were analyzed before and after the feeding trials. The findings revealed that the Eclipta-supplemented group showed a marked reduction in mean arterial pressure by 15%, total cholesterol (17%), low-density lipoprotein fraction (24%), triglycerides (14%), very-low-density lipoprotein fraction (14%), and plasma lipid peroxides (18%). Results also revealed a remarkable increase in urine volume (34%), urine sodium (24%), serum vitamin C (17%), and serum tocopherols (23%) of the Eclipta group. In conclusion, it would appear that E. alba is diuretic, hypotensive, and hypocholesterolemic and helps in the alleviating oxidative stress-induced complications in hypertensives. {\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. and Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance There is very limited information regarding plants used by traditional healers in Bandarban Hill Tracts (BHT), Bangladesh for treating general as well as complex ailments. Current study provides significant ethnopharmacological information, both qualitative and quantitative on medical plants in BHT. Aim of the study This study aimed to collect, analyze and evaluate the rich ethnopharmacologic knowledge on medicinal plants in Thanchi, BHT and attempted to identify the important species used in traditional medicine. Further analysis was done by comparison of the traditional medicinal use of the plants with the available scientific literature data. Materials and methods The field survey was carried out in a period of several years in Thanchi upazilla of Bandarban districts, Bangladesh. A total of 53 Traditional Health Practitioners (THPs) were interviewed through open-ended and semi structured questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. This ethnomedicinal knowledge was compared against the available scientific literature for reports of related uses and studies of phytochemical compounds responsible for respective ailments. Results A total of 84 species of plants, mostly herbs, belonging to 42 families were identified for the treatment of 70 types of ailments. These ailments were categorized into 16 categories. Leaves were the most frequently used plant parts and juice is the mode of preparation of major portions of the plant species. The most common mode of administration was oral ingestion and topical application. Informant consensus factor (Fic) values of the present study reflected the high agreement in the use of plants in the treatment of digestive system and respiratory system disorders among the informants. Diseases of the digestive system had highest use-reports and 3 species of plants, namely Centella asiatica (L.) Urban. (dysentery), Justicia gendarussa L. (asthma) and Ocimum tenuiflorum L. (coughing) had the highest fidelity level (FL) of 100%. Clerodendrum viscosum Vent., Achyranthes aspera L and Justicia gendarussa L. showed the highest relative importance (RI) value of 1.86. According to use value (UV) the most important species were Ocimum tenuiflorum L. (2.24) and Achyranthes aspera L. (2.15). Conclusion Priority should be given for further phytochemical investigation to plants that scored highest FL, Fic, UV or RI values, as such values could be considered as good indicator of prospective plants for discovering new drugs. Since knowledge regarding traditional medicine being vulnerable day by day so traditional medicine in school curricula should be incorporated so that younger people could appreciate its usefulness. Also counseling of THPs and gardening of medicinal plants should be taken into consideration immediately in order to smooth continuance and extension of traditional medical knowledge and practice for ensuring safe and effective therapy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {The water bodies within industrial areas are often used for the disposal of effluents leading to metal contamination in water, soil, and vegetation. However, the impact of metal enrichment in the food grown in these areas has not been much explored. The present study investigates the food chain contamination of eight metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn) in the milk from the cattle grazing on a shallow lake bed within the industrial town of Ranipet, India, and associated health risk from the consumption by adults and children. It also considers the possible sources of metals into the cattle from water, forage, and soil. The total number of cattle grazing in the study area was identified, along with their average daily intakes. The total milk yield from these cattle and the milk consumption rates were identified from surveys conducted among cattle owners and milk buyers. The primary sources of all the metals, except Al are forage; whereas for Al, it is the soil. The projected milk consumption pattern indicates that 531 children and 1279 adults drinking contaminated milk are at considerable risk. The hazard indices ranged from 0.86 to 2.74 for children, and 0.35 to 1.13 for adults. The Cancer Risk values for Cd and Cr were above 10−4 for adults and children, signify serious health risk. The analyses of tail switch hair samples indicated that cattle are also environmentally exposed to metals indicating their subclinical effect. Hence, the study substantiates that soil can be a potential source of metals in the food chain, and apprises stringent quality control and monitoring food chain contamination from milk in industrial belts.},

abstract = {Siddha medicine and Ayurveda are the two most ancient medical systems of India. The word Siddha means established truth. Siddha was the mother for all Asian traditional medicines. The founders and promoters of such a Siddha school of thought were known as Siddhars. These mystic people recorded their findings in medicine, yoga, and astrology in Tamil and Sanskrit. Fundamental Principles of Siddha include theories of Five Elements (Aimpootham), and Three Forces/Faults (Mukkuttram). The Eight Methods of Examination (Envakai Thervukal) is used to determine diagnosis, etiology, treatment and prognosis. The author who is qualified in modern medicine and Siddha tries to present a comprehensive account of the relevance of Siddha Medicine in the contemporary practice of dermatology in areas where it is really competitive to modern dermatology with exclusive evidences from his clinical practice. Skin diseases are known as Thol Noikal in Siddha. We do not have any ancient text book of Siddha devoted entirely to dermatology. Siddha describes skin conditions under the following broad headings namely Karappan, Punkal, Amman, Kuttam, Vida kadi etc.It is difficult to equate these Siddha technical terms to the terms of modern dermatology. Siddha has safe herbal and herbomineral treatment for psoriasis, eczema, alopecia, diabetic ulcer, warts, vitiligo, pemphigus, pompholyx, leprosy, and many more very common and rare diseases. Lifestyle modifications including diet are important. Karappan: Karappan is the major classification under which many of the skin conditions are explained in Siddha. The definition for Karappan is so broad that it is possible to describe any skin condition under this term. Simple conditions like eczema to complicated cancer penis are discussed under the heading of Karappan. Psoriasis, eczema, fungal, bacterial infections, and a variety of other skin conditions can be considered under Karappan. Eczema - In various types of dermatitis, laxatives are given initially for 3 days. Herb mineral drugs like Rasaganthi mezhuku, decoctions and powders containing Smilax china are extensively used. Impetigo contagiosa and erysipelas - These conditions respond well to Pachai ennai, an oil made from Datura stramonium leaves and Vetchipoo thailam, an oil prepared from flowers of Ixora coccinea . Lichenoid papules (Karanai) - In Prurigo nodularis Rasaganthi mezhuku. orally and Chirattai thailam externally control the condition satisfactorily Psoriasis - Siddha has revolutionized Psoriasis treatment with simple herbal oils and decoctions. Kanda karappan and Kutta karappan denote generalized plaque type of psoriasis all over the body. Manda karappan means psoriatic scalp. Vata karappan/ Thimir Vata Karappan denote psoriatic arthritis. The condition explained under kalanchaka vatam also fit into psoriatic arthritis. Some call psoriasis as kalanchaka padai. Vetpalai (Wrightia tinctoria) thailam, an oil is the main stay of Siddha treatment. Chirattai thailam, an oil derived by destructive distillation of dry coconut shells, is used as a keratolytic. Several other herbal and herbomineral drugs are also used. Erythroderma (Chattai karappan) - An emergency condition like psoriatic erythroderma can be treated with drugs used for psoriasis. Diabetic ulcer - Siddha considers diabetes mellitus as meka noi because urine is faulty. Diabetic foot ulcers often lead to amputations. Siddha treatment given by the author has prevented several amputations. Medicated gauzes (Kara cheelai) are mentioned in Siddha to dress ulcers. Apart from the work conducted by the author, there is no other report regarding their use in contemporary practice. Medicated gauzes are named by their color such as green, yellow, red, etc. Herbal oils and other forms of preparations are also mentioned in Siddha texts. Further extensive research is needed. Vesiculo bullous diseases (Koppula Noi): Pemphigus vulgaris - Pemphigus vulgaris, the killer skin disease can be handled without systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppresses. Pompholyx (Kai Kaal Koppula Noi/Koppula Karappan) - This is another blistering disease characterized by bilateral symmetrical vesicular eruptions of the palms and sole. Siddha herb mineral drugs internally and Pachai ennai for external application are used by the author. This frequently relapsing bothersome disease responds to Siddha treatment. Leprosy (Kuttam) - The influence of modern medicine is so profound that no leprosy patient usually comes for Siddha treatment. The author has so far treated a few leprosy patients who did not get satisfactory results with multidrug therapy. It is possible to treat multidrug resistant cases as well as Erythema Nodosum Leprosum or Type II reaction due to multidrug treatment Cosmetic Medicine: Acne (Mukaparu) and Prickly heat (Verkuru) - are treated with herbal pastes. In cases of acne, the author prescribes laxatives to relieve chronic constipation often found in patients before starting the treatment Warts - Ammai denotes pox diseases caused by viral infections. Siddha calls warts as unni. Isolated lesions can be removed with local application of herbomineral preparations that function like a chemical cautery. Wide spread warts also respond to Siddha treatment Premature graying of hair (Ilam Narai) - Premature graying of hair (Ilam Narai) treated successfully in patients in the age group not exceeding the teens. It takes three months to restore the hair to its black colour. The author has not failed in any one case so far. Alopecia - Different forms of alopecia respond well to Siddha herbal oils. A rare cosmetic surgey for alopecia outlined in ancient Siddha text but hither to not practiced was established to be successful by the author. According to the ancient text the denuded area is pricked with Sankan mul (thorn of Azima tetracantha). This is followed by application of a paste of Arsenic penta sulfide ground with fresh juice of Eclipta prostrata. The author used to infiltrate the area with local anesthetic and prick with a hypodermic needle and apply drugs. The author was astonished to find after some years that in cosmetic medicine now they are using derma comb, derma roller with fine needles for the same purpose of promoting hair growth in alopecia. Vitiligo (Ven Kuttam) - In brown- or dark-skinned individuals, depigmentation resulting in vitiligo is a social stigma in India. These unfortunate ones are looked upon and discriminated as lepers by some. Treating widespread vitiligo with drugs alone is still a problem. Only after exhausting all the avenues in Allopathy people come to Siddha practitioners. The author modified the so-far established line of Siddha treatment. It was a great success. Now, treating vitiligo has become very simple. Anyhow further research is needed.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Myanmar's Mon people largely depend on a traditional medical system for health care, however, information about their medical plants is rare in the current literature. In this first ethnobotanical study of Mon traditional medicinal plants (MTMs), we attempt to answer three research questions: 1) What species are used as MTMs by the Mon people and what diseases can be treated with these MTMs? 2) What are the general characteristics of these MTMs? 3) Which species and their usages have high consensus of knowledge? Aim of the study: We aimed (1) to document both the diversity of medicinal plants used by the Mon people and their knowledge of the therapeutic usages of these plants; and (2) to quantitatively identify the most well-known medicinal plant species and prevalent diseases treated by these species, and to evaluate the status of scientific research and application for each of these species. Materials and methods: Ethnobotanical surveys and interviews were carried out in 10 villages in four townships of Mon State, Myanmar in 2018. Data were collected from interviews with 131 informants, chosen via the snowball sampling method. Therapeutic uses of medicinal plants were categorized according to the ICPC-2 standard. Voucher specimens of plant species were collected and identified by experts. To evaluate the consensus of knowledge, we applied use reports (URs) using the R package of ethnobotanyR. Results: In total, we recorded 158 medicinal plant species belonging to 64 families as being used by the Mon people, with 13 species being newly recorded as medicinal plants in Myanmar. The people listed 78 therapeutic uses for these plants, which could be classified into 16 ICPC-2 disease categories. Digestive, urological and respiratory diseases ranked as the most prevalent diseases based on use reports. Fabaceae was the most represented family and the leaf was the most commonly used plant part. Decoction and oral administration ranked top in preparation and administration methods, respectively. Tinospora sinensis (Lour.) Merr, the introduced species Chromolaena odorata (L.) R. M. King & H. Rob., Mimosa pudica L., Tadehagi triquetrum (L.) H. Ohashi, and Alysicarpus vaginalis (L.) DC were the five most cited medicinal plant species, and were used to treat dysuria, cuts and wounds, cough, diabetes and gall stones respectively, with high consensus. Conclusion: The Mon people of Myanmar have a rich and diverse knowledge of traditional medicinal plants. The list of medicinal plants in Myanmar can be renewed, with the addition of 13 species. MTMs still function as an important component of the health care of the Mon people in Myanmar, and a systematic documentation of the local knowledge of MTMs would be of great value in the future. Resource monitoring, phytochemical and pharmacological research and evidence-based drug development are suggested to promote the use of MTMs and aid drug discovery.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance Traditional remedies used for the treatment of various ailments are considered to be very important in the primary health care of Reang people living in Tripura state of Northeast India. Novel information gathered from the present investigation is important in preserving folk indigenous knowledge of Reang tribe. Methods Systematic and exhaustive field surveys were conducted during 2003 to 2004 in Reang inhabited areas of Tripura state of Northeast India covering all the seasons, to gather information on medicinal herbs used by them in the treatment of various ailments. Information was collected from 55 traditional herbalists of different age through structured questionnaires and personal observations made during the field visit. The data obtained was analyzed through informant consensus factor (FIC) to determine the homogeneity of informant's knowledge on medicinal plants also the fidelity level (FL) to authenticate the uniqueness of a species to treat a particular ailment. Results In the present study a total of 125 medicinal plants species belonging to 116 genera and 59 families were presented, used for treating 42 different ailments. The major plant parts used are leaves and most of the remedies are suggested to take orally. The greatest parts of plants used for curing various ailments were found locally. The consensus analysis revealed that the fever and gastro-intestinal diseases have the highest informant consensus factor FIC of 0.79 followed by the dermatological problems (FIC 0.78). It is equal (FIC 0.77) for both general health problems and inflammation and pain while urinogenital problems showed relatively low levels of consensus (FIC 0.63). The level of informants' consent was high for most ailment categories indicating greater homogeneity among informants. In the present study we analyzed the disease categories to highlight some of the important plant species in terms of Fidelity level. Greater parts of the plant species achieve highest fidelity level, while only 4% acquire lower FL. The species with high citation and informant concurrence value are reasonably significant. Cyathea, a rare tree fern used for major cuts or wounds for immediate blood coagulation. Extensive local application may threaten the species if not judiciously managed. Conclusion The traditional pharmacopoeia of the Reang ethnic group incorporates a myriad of diverse flora available locally. Traditional knowledge of the remedies is passed down through oral traditions without any written document. This traditional knowledge is however, currently threatened mainly due to acculturation and deforestation. Therefore, documenting medicinal plants and associated indigenous knowledge can be used as a basis for developing management plans for conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants of the study area. In addition, findings of this study can be used as an ethnopharmacological basis for selecting plants for future phytochemical and pharmaceutical studies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Hajong people use many medicinal plants in their different rituals. The information generated from the present study regarding the medico-religious plants used by the Hajong tribes need a thorough phytochemical investigation. This could help in creating awareness regarding the need for conservation of such plants and also in the promotion of ethno-medico-botany knowledge within the region besides contributing to the preservation and enrich- ment of the gene bank of such economically important species before they are lost forever. Medico-religious plants so found out in this study should be screened for their efficacy by which new drugs or products could be brought out. There is also need to document this information and compare with that of other tribes in the state and region. Materials and Methods: The diseases found during the research work among the Hajong community were grouped in 11 categories. The category of diseases includes plants used for both human and animal diseases. The informants having good knowledge on medico-religious plants were chosen for the interview. Kabiraj or Vaidyas were also included among the informants though they were not available in all villages. The informants were asked about the ritual and religious importance and the medicinal properties of the plants used in different cultural practices. Results: Some 36 plant species including herbs, shrubs and trees are used for curing 51 different diseases with 63 formulations which are recorded during the study. Most of the medicinal plants were collected from their own homestead and rest from the forest. Hajongs make sustainable use of available natural resources that include both medicinal and religious plants. They lead a much disciplined life. They are very much religious and knowledgeable. The survey revealed that not only the Kabiraj but also the elder community member have good knowledge of the medicinal value of some plant usually those species used to treat common diseases like cough, cold, fever, viral fever, headache, stomachache, joint pain, diarrhea, dysentery, minor wounds and cuts etc. Thus 36 plants are found to be used by Hajong in different medico-religious practices. These are regarded as holy plants. These plants are strictly protected by the community. Traditional conservation and management on cultural grounds, therefore, represents a historic contribution to the present day rich biodiversity in the region. Conclusion: The whole life system and socio-economic as well as religious and cultural activities of Hajongs were totally dependent upon forests. It reflected their high possession of knowledge on medico religious plants which allowed them to apply their indigenous knowledge regarding various aspects of exploitation of such resources. Different types of important species have been disappeared from the study area, which ultimately creates social, economical and religious problem in Hajong community. The information generated from the present study regarding the medico-religious plants used by the Hajong tribes need a thorough phytochemical investigation. This could help in creating awareness regarding the need for conservation of such plants and also in the promotion of ethno-medico-botany knowledge within the region besides contributing to the preservation and enrichment of the gene bank of such economically important species before they are lost forever. Traditional culture in different Hajong populated areas is very fast declining with lot of traditional knowledge under the influence of dominant culture. Cultural diversity conservation is needed urgently. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effects of a defined formula of Chinese medicinal herbs (CMH) on menopausal symptoms. Design: A double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial. Methods: Between August 1998 and April 1999, 55 postmenopausal Australian women recruited from an urban population completed 12 weeks of intervention with either a defined formula of CMH (n=28) or placebo (n=27) taken twice daily as a beverage. Main outcome measures: The primary end-point was change in frequency of vasomotor events (hot flushes and night sweats). The secondary end-points were changes in score for the domains measured in the Menopause Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) Questionnaire. Results: There was a reduction in average weekly frequency of vasomotor events with CMH (-15%; 95% Cl, -31% to + 1%) and with placebo (-31%; 95% Cl, -42% to -21%). The difference between groups favoured the use of placebo; however, this was not significant (P=0.09). Although significant reductions in scores for the various domains of the MENQOL Questionnaire were observed for both CMH and placebo, there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups for any domain. There was evidence for effect modification by previous use of natural therapies for the vasomotor, physical and sexual domains of the MENQOL Questionnaire: Women with no prior use of natural therapies for their menopausal symptoms responded to therapy, whereas prior users did not. Conclusions: The defined formula of CMH was no more effective than placebo in reducing vasomotor episodes in Australian postmenopausal women, or in improving any of the four symptom domains in the MENQOL Questionnaire. Three of the MENQOL Questionnaire domains were modified by prior use of natural therapies. This finding has implications for future studies.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance Malaria is among the most prevalent infectious diseases in the developing countries of world. Estimated number of annual malaria episodes in Pakistan is 1.5 million, but very little is known about medicinal plant species of Pakistan, which have great potential against malarial disease. Present study was aimed to document medicinal plant species used by the local inhabitants of Lesser Himalayas-Pakistan to treat malaria. Materials and methods Data were collected through interviews, questionnaires and contributor observation. A total of 55 informants aged between 25 and 80 years who were familiar with malarial disease participated in the survey. Results A total of 84 plant species belonging to 69 genera and 50 families were recorded to treat malaria. Asteraceae was found as most cited botanical family with (11.9%) representation, followed by Lamiaceae (5.9%), Solanaceae and Verbenaceae (4.7%) and Violaceae (3.5%) respectively. About 60% of the inhabitants prefer herbal treatment by local herbalists or self-treatment with locally available medicinal plant species. Of the plants identified during present investigation against malaria, Azadirachta indica, Swertia chirayita and Swertia ciliata exhibited uppermost frequency of encounter (36.3%) and corresponding PR value 5. About 67.2% of the botanical taxa are reported for the first time in the treatment of malaria. It was observed thatover harvesting is the foremost threat to medicinal plant species of the study area. Conclusion Present survey indicates that traditional knowledge about the use of plant species against various diseases and particularly to treat malaria is in decline. Similarly anthropogenic pressure, over exploitation and grazing of the botanical taxa are the major concerns regarding medicinal plant biodiversity loss. Frequently utilized plant species with significant malarial reduction should be authenticated by in vitro and in vivo standard tests {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objective. To identify the biological function and metabolic pathway of differential metabolites in follicular fluid of senile patients with kidney qi deficiency undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) and observe the effect of kidney-invigorating herbs on IVF outcomes in senile patients. Methods. A total of 95 women undergoing IVF treatment were recruited and divided into three groups, including 34 cases in the treatment group (the senile patients with kidney qi deficiency after the intervention of Chinese medicine), 31 cases in the experiment group (the senile patients with kidney qi deficiency of no intervention of Chinese medicine), and 30 cases in the control group (young women with infertility due to male factor). The three groups of women were treated with long protocol ovarian hyperstimulation; the treatment group was given Qi-Zi-Yu-Si decoction on the day of HCG downregulation. Their IVF clinical outcomes were observed. The metabolites changes of kidney qi deficiency syndrome were analyzed in follicular fluid metabolomics using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Results. The syndrome score of kidney qi deficiency syndrome in the treatment group was significantly improved after treatment (P<0.01). Compared with the experiment group, the available embryo rate and implantation rate were increased, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Progesterone, indoleacrylic acid, 2-propenyl 1-(1-propenylsulfinyl) propyl disulfide, N-acetyltryptophan, decanoylcarnitine, 20a-dihydroprogesterone, testosterone acetate, eicosatrienoic acid, 1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde, choline, phosphorylcholine, and tryptophan were downregulated in the treatment group. Through pathway analysis, glycerophospholipid metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis were regulated in senile patients with kidney qi deficiency after Qi-Zi-Yu-Si decoction intervention. Conclusion. Qi-Zi-Yu-Si decoction can effectively improve the IVF outcome and clinical symptoms of senile patients. Follicular fluid metabolites were significantly changed in senile infertile women with kidney qi deficiency, and the mechanism by which kidney-invigorating herbs improve IVF treatment outcomes may be related to glycerophospholipid metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis.

abstract = {Female infertility and low birth rate are significant public health issues with profound social, psychological, and economic consequences. Some infertile women resort to conventional, complementary, or alternative therapies to conceive. The aim of this study was to identify the Chinese herbal products (CHPs) most commonly used for female infertility in Taiwan. The usage of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the frequency of CHP prescriptions to infertile women were determined based on a nationwide 1-million randomly sampled cohort of National Health Insurance Research Database beneficiaries. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analysis were employed to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for TCM usage and potential risk factors. In total, 8766 women with newly diagnosed infertility were included in this study. Of those, 8430 (96.17%) had sought TCM treatment in addition to visiting the gynecologist. We noted that female infertility patients with risk factors (e.g., endometriosis, uterine fibroids, or irregular menstrual cycle) were more likely to use TCM than those without TCM medication (aOR = 1.83, 1.87, and 1.79, respectively). The most commonly used formula and single CHP were Dang-Gui-Sha- Yao-San (17.25%) and Semen Cuscutae (27.40%), respectively. CHP formula combinations (e.g., Dang-Gui-Sha-Yao-San plus Wen-Jing- Tang 3.10%) or single Chinese herbal combinations (e.g., Semen Cuscutae plus Leonurus japonicus 6.31%) were also commonly used to treat female infertility. Further well-conducted, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies will be needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these CHP combinations for female infertility.},

abstract = {Background: Anti-VEGF agent ranibizumab has been extensively used as a standard treatment for wet AMD. We investigated whether traditional Chinese medicine could serve as a complementary therapy for this disease. Methods: 144 patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration received either intravitreal ranibizumab treatment as needed plus placebo or intravitreal ranibizumab treatment as needed plus an FDA approved traditional Chinese patent medicine named ZQMT. Both groups received treatment for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the mean change of visual acuity at week 24 as compared to the baseline. Results: We found that intravitreal ranibizumab treatment plus ZQMT was non-inferior to the treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab alone in improving visual acuity scores at week 24 with patients in both groups who gained substantial numbers of letters. In addition, we found that ZQMT treatment resulted in significant improvements in reducing retinal hemorrhage, fluid, and lesion size. Importantly, administration of ZQMT reduced the number of needed ranibizumab injections (P<0.0001, analysis of variance) in wet AMD patients leading to a significant reduction of drug cost. Conclusion: The combinatory therapy of ranibizumab and traditional Chinese patent medicine ZQMT had equivalent effects on visual acuity improvement and safety profiles as the ranibizumab treatment alone. Ranibizumab injections coupled with ZQMT offer therapeutic advantages in terms of reduction of retinal lesions and ease the financial burden of patients undergoing treatment by reducing the frequency of necessary ranibizumab injections.},

abstract = {Hair is an important component of the body derived from ectoderm of skin. Keratin is the main component of hair fibers. Hair has great psycho-social significance for persons. The average growth rate in a normal scalp is 0.41 mm per day but lower growth rate is observed among aged persons and chronic disease persons. Hair loss is a most common problem among men and women of all age groups and it is a socially and psychologically distressing also. Its severity varies from a small bare patch to a more diffuse and obvious pattern. Diffuse hair loss may occur at any age and gender. It affects the whole scalp. Management of hair fall is extremely complex. Treatments for the various forms are available but alopecia has limited success. As a general rule, it is easier to maintain remaining hair than it is to re-grow; however, the success rate is very less with unwanted adverse effects. There are claims that poly herbal formulations are giving promising results. So, a poly herbal formulation 'Hairbac' tablet and oil, is evaluated for its safety and efficacy in diffuse hair loss. The subjective parameters used for assessment were Hair Texture, Hair Density/cm sq area and Hair Loss. The beneficial effects of Hairbac Tablets and Oil assessed in the context of hair texture, density /1cm2 and hair loss among females suffering with diffuse hair fall showed highly significant improvement without any adverse effects assessed by the respondents.},

It was COVID-19 pandemic, when world realized ayurveda co-interventions are praiseworthy even in acute, infective and fatal conditions like COVID-19. We report perhaps first case of COVID-19 patient with cancer managed with poly-herbal ayurvedic formulation and integrated approach. In the first wave of COVID-19 (June 2020), a 47 year old male with history of Chronic kidney disease and active B Cell Lymphoma complained of fever, malaise, cattarah and ageusia. He was found positive on RT-PCR which was done promptly and was later treated in home quarantine with antipyretics, Vitamin C and Madhav rasayan a polyherbal preparation containing Piper longum, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Eclipta alba, Achyranthes aspera, Embelia ribes and Aloe vera designed to modulate host response. It was challenging to treat a patient with cancer with immunocompromised status as he had recently finished his chemotherapy cycle (R–CHOP regimen). Patient well tolerated the intervention and recovered symptomatically. He did not developed any respiratory complications and oxygen saturation remained maintained. On 7th day RT-PCR was found to be negative. Plethora of literature is available on anti-viral and immunomodulatory efficacies of Ayurveda herbs based on in vitro studies. Such efficacies can be replicated at patient's level if supported with wisdom of Ayurveda epistemology. Early diagnosis on RT-PCR and early inception of ayurveda medicine and diet interventions might be crucial element for better recovery.},

abstract = {Eclipta prostrata, a traditional Chinese medication, has been used for the treatment of several diseases. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of Eclipta prostrata extracts (EPE) on human oral cancer cell metastasis remains unclear. We thus examined the effects of EPE on metastasis promoting proteins in oral cancer. Our results revealed that the EPE attenuated SCC-9, HSC-3, and TW2.6 cell migration and invasiveness by reducing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 enzyme activities. In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that EPE significantly reduced the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) but not those of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1/2 and p38. In conclusion, we found that EPE could inhibit oral cancer metastasis through the inhibition of MMP-2 expression. Therefore, EPE may be used to prevent the metastasis of oral cancer, and has the potential to be applied to cancer treatment.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Rich accessibility of medicinal plants in the study area provides low cost health care for respiratory disorders to local communities. This first report survey was commenced with an aim to document ethnic knowledge regarding the use of folk herbal medicine for respiratory diseases among the local communities of Gallies Abbottabad, Northern Pakistan using quantitative ethnobotanical approaches.
Method: Field survey was carried out over the period of 2 years i.e., March 2012-March 2014 in study area. The ethnomedicinal data was collected through interviews among the local communities. Documented data was evaluated using use value (UV) and Relative Frequency Citation (RFC).
Results: A total of 120 species of plants belonging to 90 genera of 51 families were reported to be used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of 25 different respiratory disorders. Leaves were the most commonly used plant parts and most of the herbal medicines were prepared in the form of decoctions and administered orally. The most significant species according to their use value were Solanum virginianum (5.00), Althea officinalis (3.00), Inula obtusifolia (3.00), Saxifraga hirculus (3.00) and Sisymbrium erysimoides (3.00).
Conclusion: This study reported traditional herbal medicines for the first time to be used against respiratory disorders in the Gallies, Northern Pakistan are still in common practice by the local communities. Some of the new ethnobotanical claims documented in this investigation should need to be further explore clinically. The medicinal plants with highest use values recorded in this study may signpost the probable existence of valuable phytochemical compounds that requires a search for prospective new drugs to cure many respiratory disorders.},

abstract = {Few effective biomedical treatment options exist for chronic pain of unknown origin. Treatment is usually palliative, with opioid and non-opioid analgesic drugs frequently prescribed. While these drugs may provide some relief, they usually require continuous use, they rarely lead to long-term improvement, and they often have negative side effects. Consequently, increasing numbers of these patients are turning to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In the United States, TCM is known mainly for acupuncture, but another TCM modality, Chinese herbal medicine, is an effective and comprehensive system deserving of more attention. Customised Chinese herbal formulas usually consist of several herbs, chosen via TCM's sophisticated model of therapeutic synergy, to address each individual's underlying aberrant physiological mechanisms as well as their presenting symptoms. In recent decades, convenience issues such as preparation time, affordability and portability have effected a shift away from the primary traditional method of administration - decoction - toward powders, pills, and concentrates. This case study details the treatment of a 56-year-old female with widespread, chronic, idiopathic pain using only Chinese herbs in powdered form. Though she reported no benefit from treatment with acupuncture, pharmaceutical drugs or massage, she claimed a dramatic improvement with herbs. Her herbal treatment fit her limited budget, and was free of any side effects, allowing her to work and exercise. It is reasonable to conclude that innumerable others struggling with chronic idiopathic pain might benefit similarly from Chinese herbs, though this clearly warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medicinal properties of the food species are one of the poorly documented and important areas of ethnopharmacology. The present survey quantitatively documented the medicinal foods prescribed by the non-institutionally trained siddha practitioners of Tiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu. METHODS: Field work was carried out between December 2014 and April 2017 using a questionnaire. The illnesses mentioned by the informants were grouped as illness categories on the basis of emic perceptions. Sufficiency of sampling of this survey was assessed by plotting the cumulative number of UR and Shannon-Wiener's index. The indices such as informant consensus factor (FIC), Index of Agreement on Remedies (IAR), and Cultural Food Significance Index (CFSI) were calculated. RESULTS: This study documented 165 medicinal foods used by 82 non-institutionally trained siddha practitioners of Tiruvallur district, and 73.93% of these preparations were plant based. Among the animal taxa, 82.05% were represented by fish taxa. The illness category gastrointestinal ailments is the majorly cited illness category treated with plant-based formulations. The illness categories viz., gastrointestinal ailments, hemorrhoids, and neural ailments had high consensus under the group of plant-based medicinal foods. In animal-based medicinal foods, kapha ailments had gained 23.07% of UR. The illness categories such as bone fractures, male reproductive ailments, blood ailments, and anabolic had high FIC values. CONCLUSIONS: Deeper studies on different dietary cultures of India may help to derive better interpretations on food-medicine continuum. This study identified some important claims such as the use of citron, pomegranate and Solanum americanum (gastrointestinal ailments), Abutilon indicum, onions and elephant foot yam (hemorrhoids), Boerhavia diffusa (urinary ailments), Moringa oleifera (anemia), Aloe vera (gynecological ailments), Eclipta prostrata (liver ailments), ivy gourd (diabetes), citron (hypertension), Centella asiatica (psychological ailments), spade nose shark (lactogogue), reticulate whipray (wheezing and bronchitis), Katelysia opima (impotence), Indian squid (anemia), and Indian oil sardine (anabolic). More studies on these claims will help identify novel functional foods to add to the field of medical nutrition therapy, with traditional brand identity. Robust studies on the documentation of the traditional knowledge on marine resources will yield a good database for various stakeholders and policy makers.},

The present study was carried out to document and investigate the existing ethnomedicinal knowledge on local flora of Kapurthala district, Punjab, India. Materials and Methods: The ethnomedicinal investigation was carried out from March 2015 to October 2017. Key informants, rural as well as urban, i.e., herbal doctors, homemakers, farmers, elders, etc., were selected using snowball sampling method. Information on ethnomedicinal importance of plants of this region and methods of preparation and administration was gathered by questionnaire-based personal interviews, group discussions, informal meetings, and field observations with local people. Results: Fifty plant species belonging to thirty families were informed to be used for medicinal purposes. Fruits and leaves were the most used plant parts. The most commonly used mode of administration was raw form or juice of plant parts. Most of the information was recorded for the treatment of gastrointestinal problems. Conclusions: This study reveals the interesting use of plants by the local people of Kapurthala district, which shows that use of medicinal plants still exists. However, because of modernization, traditional knowledge is losing at high rate; there is a need to conserve our ancestral knowledge. Further, medicinal plants should be examined for pharmacological and phytochemical studies for novel drug discovery.},

The prebiotic potential of nervine herbal medicines has been scarcely studied. We therefore used anaerobic human fecal cultivation to investigate whether medicinal herbs commonly used as treatment in neurological health and disease in Ayurveda and other traditional systems of medicine modulate gut microbiota. Profiling of fecal cultures supplemented with either Kapikacchu, Gotu Kola, Bacopa/Brahmi, Shankhapushpi, Boswellia/Frankincense, Jatamansi, Bhringaraj, Guduchi, Ashwagandha or Shatavari by 16S rRNA sequencing revealed profound changes in diverse taxa. Principal coordinate analysis highlights that each herb drives the formation of unique microbial communities predicted to display unique metabolic potential. The relative abundance of approximately one-third of the 243 enumerated species was altered by all herbs. Additional species were impacted in an herb-specific manner. In this study, we combine genome reconstruction of sugar utilization and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) pathways encoded in the genomes of 216 profiled taxa with monosaccharide composition analysis of each medicinal herb by quantitative mass spectrometry to enhance the interpretation of resulting microbial communities and discern potential drivers of microbiota restructuring. Collectively, our results indicate that gut microbiota engage in both protein and glycan catabolism, providing amino acid and sugar substrates that are consumed by fermentative species. We identified taxa that are efficient amino acid fermenters and those capable of both amino acid and sugar fermentation. Herb-induced microbial communities are predicted to alter the relative abundance of taxa encoding SCFA (butyrate and propionate) pathways. Co-occurrence network analyses identified a large number of taxa pairs in medicinal herb cultures. Some of these pairs displayed related culture growth relationships in replicate cultures highlighting potential functional interactions among medicinal herb-induced taxa.},

abstract = {Aims of the study The aim of this study is to collect information on the use of medicinal plants by the local Hoklos people on Hainan Island, and compare medicinal traditions in the study area with Li medicines (LM) and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Materials and methods Ethnobotanical data were collected by 3 means: semi-structured interviews, personal conversation and guided field trips. There were 27 informants from 9 towns and 14 villages who were visited. Quantitative indices (Informant Consensus Factor – FIC, Use Value – UV, and Fidelity Level – FL) were calculated. Results In the present study, 264 species from 92 families and 233 genera were recorded, with Compositae (20 species), Leguminosae (19 species), Rubiaceae (12 species) and Gramineae (11 species) as predominate families. Leaves were the most frequently used parts in the preparation of local medicines. The most common preparation method was decoction (452 mentions). The plant with the highest values was Eclipta prostrata (0.46). The 6 plant species with the maximum FL (100%) were Atalantia buxifolia (Poir.) Oliv., Garcinia oblongifolia Champ. ex Benth., Hypericum japonicum Thunb. ex Murray, Imperata cylindrica (L.) Beauv., Microcos paniculata L., and Psidium guajava L. In addition, 120 investigated human ailments were grouped into 10 categories, within which symptoms and signs (184 mentions), diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (139 mentions) and diseases of the digestive system (94 mentions) were the most mentioned in our investigation. The informant consensus about using medicinal plants ranged from 0.27 to 0.48, which showed a high level of agreement among the informants on symptoms and signs (0.48) and certain infectious and parasitic diseases (0.43). In comparison with TCM and LM, the results reflected a closer connection between local medicine and TCM. Conclusion The information reported by Hoklos people is of great value to ethnic medicinal culture. However, this precious medicinal knowledge is at risk of being lost due to rapid degradation of the environment. It is essential that more people engage in in-depth studies on local medicinal plants and relevant organizations address this serious problem before the damage is irreversible.},

abstract = {Ethno-pharmacological relevance: Chinese herbal products (CHP) are commonly used for menopausal syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Aim of the study: Because menopausal syndrome is a common issue among women worldwide, this study analyzed the prescription patterns and frequencies of CHP in relieving menopausal syndrome in Taiwan. Materials and methods: Prescriptions of CHP for menopausal syndrome were obtained from the nationwide prescription database (National Health Insurance Research Database) of Taiwan. Every prescription with a leading diagnosis of menopausal syndrome made in the year 2002 for women out-patients aged 45-55 years was analyzed. Descriptive statistics and data mining method (association rule mining) were applied to the pattern of co-prescription. Results: A total of 54 456 prescriptions were made for 15 486 subjects in clinical visits. Salvia miltiorrhiza and Dan-zhi-xiao-yao-san were the most commonly prescribed single herb (SH) and herbal formula (HF), respectively. For combinations of two CHP, Salvia miltiorrhiza with Dan-zhi-xiao-yao-san, Zhi-bai-di-huang-wan with Dan-zhi-xiao-yao-san, and Ligustrum lucidum with Eclipta prostrata were the most frequently co-prescribed CHP couplets as SH-HF, HF-HF, and SH-SH, respectively. The most commonly used combination of three CHP was Eclipta prostrata with Ligustrum lucidum and Dan-zhi-xiao-yao-san. The core formula for menopausal syndrome was Dan-zhi-xiao-yao-san. Conclusions: Combinations of CHP are widely used for menopausal syndrome. Data mining analysis demonstrates the core formula and the commonly combined CHP in prescriptions. Further studies are needed to evaluate their efficacy for menopausal syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background/Objectives: External and mental stress from hair loss degrades the quality of life and affects the interpersonal relationship and daily social life of individuals. Lately, due to an increase in hair loss population, various chemically synthesized products for hair loss prevention or treatment have been commercialized in the market. However, these products have well-known adverse effects. In order to prevent such adverse effects, this study aimed to develop a natural substance and utilize a tool that aids its transdermal delivery. This study intended to elucidate the scalp health and hair loss prevention effects of Eclipta prostrata and microneedle therapy system (MTS) use on the scalp of office workers in their 20s and 30s who have suffered from hair loss, in addition, to present a potential product for improving scalp conditions and preventing hair loss. Method/Statistical Analysis: In order to identify the effects of the MTS and the Eclipta prostrata extract on improvement of scalp condition and prevention of hair loss, this study conducted scalp treatments on 24 office workers in their 20s and 30s who have suffered from hair loss by dividing them into three groups: MTS group, Eclipta prostrata group, and MTS-Eclipta prostrata group. The scalp treatment was performed for 10 weeks with one 30-min turn per week, resulting in 10 turns in total. The same home care products including shampoo and conditioner were distributed to all participants for use during the entire period of experiment. Hair density, hair thickness, effect on scalp improvement, and hairline distance were measured using a scalp diagnostic device (Kong Scope, Korea) and a measuring tape before, 5 weeks after, and 10 weeks after the experiment. Participants were then surveyed for satisfaction level after the experiment. Findings: In the results, all three groups showed increase in hair density and thickness and a decrease in frontal hairline distance at both hairlines, 10 weeks after the experiment. Only the MTS-Eclipta prostrata group showed a statistically significant increase in hair density from 18 ea at 0 week to 19.43 at 10 weeks, hair line thickness, and frontal hairline distance changes. The Eclipta prostrata group also showed a significant increase in hair thickness. Furthermore, majority of the participants showed clean scalps with new hair growths 10 weeks after the experiment. Improvements/Applications: It was revealed that co-treatment with MTS and Eclipta prostrata extracthad more effect on hair density, hair thickness and hairline distance change. Furthermore, the satisfaction survey result after the experiment showed a positive response for hair richness and reduction in itching and sebum amount, thereby building self-confidence. Accordingly, it was proved that the use of MTS and the Eclipta prostrata extract is effective in scalp health and hair loss improvement.},

abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Ethnobotanical surveys are a key means of preserving indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants and their application within traditional medical systems. The present survey was undertaken within the Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh, India, to collect information from the Bhil and Bhilala tribes on the use of medicinal plants in the treatment of dermatological diseases. Material and methods: The ethnobotanical data was collected from local traditional healers in 39 villages within the Jhabua district of western Madhya Pradesh, using standard ethnobotanical methods. The Use Value (UV), Fidelity Level (FL) and Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) were calculated in order to analyse the data collected and results were compared to prior ethnobotanical surveys relating to dermatological conditions conducted within India. Results: A total of 116 plant species of 103 genera, belonging to 58 families were identified as used in the treatment of a total of 21 different dermatological disorders. UV ranged from Punica granatum, with the highest value of 2.41 to Rumex dentatus, with the lowest UV of 0.11. The highest FL of 100% was found for 17 plant species, and the ICF was found to range from 0.20 (leucoderma) to 1 (mouth ulcers). Conclusions: The survey was able to identify and record the broad range of medicinal plants and practices used by the Bhil and Bhilala people in their treatment of dermatological conditions. The data collected is valuable, not only as part of the process of documenting and preserving a traditional knowledge and culture in danger of being lost, but also in its provision of a broad selection of medicinal plants that could be subjected to further pharmacological and clinical investigation for their potential role in the treatment of dermatological conditions.},

abstract = {Bajwat Wildlife Sanctuary is a complex riverine ecosystem and is unique because of the presence of river Chenab, various seasonal streams, lakes, and Head Marala barrage. These ecogeographic conditions provide diverse natural habitats for various plant and animal species to grow uninterrupted and have undocumented ethnopharmacologically important medicinal flora. The present study involves the first-ever extensive investigation to document the ethnopharmacological knowledge on medicinal plants of local healers and inhabitants of the Bajwat Wildlife Sanctuary to treat ailments. The unstructured and semistructured interviews of the local healers and inhabitants were conducted that included 130 individuals. The ethnomedicinal formulations, their method of preparation, mode of administration, parts of the plant used, diseases cured, and their categorization along with species use report (UR) were analyzed. The ethnopharmacological study led to the enlisting of 114 medicinal plant species belonging to 97 genera and distributed among 47 plant families. 2029 URs were collected with 42 general disease categories. Each plant species was reported 18 times to cure various diseases (∼18 UR), while ∼48 URs were collected on each disease category by local informants. Digestive issues (290 URs, ∼14.29%) and skin infections (279 URs, ∼13.75%) were found most commonly among the occupants of the area. The oral administration (69%) of herbal drugs and the preparation of plant extracts (32%) were the most common ethnopharmacological strategies. Inhabitants of the area were well aware of the limited use of poisonous plants. 8 (∼7%) out of the total 114 medicinal plant species were listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as Least Concern, while Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. was enlisted as near-threatened. The results of the present investigation show that the occupants of the Bajwat have sound information about the ethnopharmacological consumption of medicinal plants, and some of the novel ethnomedicinal formulations were reported which provide the basic data for further pharmacological research.},

Jixueteng Yijing Decoction was administered to those of Shen-yin deficiency syndrome: consisting of 100 g glossy privet fruit, 100 g eclipta prostrata, 90 g rehmannia rhizoma, 30 g spatholobus suberectus, 12 g dodder seed, 6 g psoralea corylifolia, 30 g prepared Gold Theragran, 9 g ass-hide gelatin, 9 g fructus lycii, 24 g Salvia miltiorrhiza, 30 g astragalus, 6 g angelica, and so on), one dose daily, decocted twice, taken in two portions. The treatment lasted to the recovery stage. The medication was gradually reduced to the follow-ups of drug discontinuance. Results After 6 -57 months of treatment, 12 patients (accounting for 19.4%) were basically cured, 14 (22.6%) relieved, 8 (12. 9%) markedly improved, 28 (45.2%) ineffectively, with the total effective rate of 54. 8%. Totally 23 patients had the body temperature ranging 37.6-38.5 degrees C at the first visit to our hospital. They took 2 h- 6 days to have pyretolysis ( <37.5 degrees C) after treatment. Twenty patients with body temperature higher than 38.5 degrees C took 4 h - 5 days to have pyretolysis after treatment. Totally 26 patients suffering from IST induced abnormalities of liver and renal functions (ALT, AST, BUN, and Cr) at the first visit were treated by IM for 2 months. They were restored to the normal levels in 25 cases. The treatment of SAA failing in IST had its specificity. The staging targeted treatment is in line with its pathophysiology. The key points for its treatment might be lie in the improvement and protection of hematopoietic microenvironment of bone marrows. The antisepsis and anti-inflammation of Chinese herbs hindered its aggravating tendency.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effect of sequential therapy for kidney-tonifying via traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on improving the fecundity and quality of life (QOL) of women with decreased ovarian reserve (DOR). Methods: A prospective and randomized controlled study was conducted, in which 80 infertile patients with DOR were selected in our hospital and randomly divided into the test group (n=40) and the control group (n=40). The control group was given sequential therapy of artificial menstrual cycle via administration of estrogen and progesterone, and the test group received sequential therapy for kidney-tonifying via TCM. Then, Kupperman indices, hormone levels, ovarian reserve functions, menopause specific quality of life questionnaire (MENQOL) scores, as well as the pregnancy rates within one year before and after treatment were compared between the two groups. Results: Compared with the control group, the levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and resistance index (RI) of ovarian stroma were significantly decreased in the test group (all P<0.001), while the levels of estradiol (E2), anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), mid-luteal phase E2, progesterone, antral follicular count (AFC), and ovarian diameter (OVD) of patients were notably increased in the test group (all P<0.001). After treatment, the Kupperman indices and MENQOL scores of the test group were considerably lower than those of the control group (P<0.001). No adverse effects were observed in the test group, whereas the incidence of adverse effects in the control group was 12.50%, although without significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). The pregnancy rate within one year in the test group was significantly higher than that of the control group (47.50% vs. 25.00%) (P<0.05). Conclusion: Sequential therapy for kidney-tonifying via TCM could effectively improve the clinical symptoms, hormone levels, and ovarian function, increase ovulation quality and pregnancy rate, and improve the QOL of DOR patients.},

Increasing evidence has indicated that pyroptosis, a novel proinflammatory programmed cell death, is linked with ocular diseases, little is known about the role of noncanonical pyroptosis in microbial keratitis. Here, we first indicated the involvement of noncanonical pyroptosis in P. aeruginosa keratitis and investigated whether wedelolactone (WDL), a major active component of Eclipta prostrate known to target caspase-11, could alleviate P. aeruginosa keratitis development. We found the expression of caspase-4/5/11 and cleaved GSDMD in corneas of P. aeruginosa keratitis patients, animal models and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced primary cultured human corneal keratocytes (piHCKs) were increased. Combining ciprofloxacin with WDL significantly ameliorated the severity of P. aeruginosa keratitis, as manifested by decreased inflammatory responses and reduced corneal epithelial defects. Consistent with these findings, WDL also dose-dependently alleviated LPS-induced noncanonical pyroptosis by reversing the increased expression of caspase-4/5 and GSDMD in piHCKs. In summary, our results demonstrated that by targeting the activation of caspase-4/5/11, wedelolactone inhibited the development of P. aeruginosa keratitis and suppressed the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Wedelolactone may be a promising anti-inflammatory candidate to combat P. aeruginosa keratitis.},

Methods: The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology conducted literature searches for relevant articles published from January 1, 2010, to November 15, 2021. A task force of medical experts developed evidence-based guideline recommendations based on a review of clinical evidence, expertise, and informal consensus, according to established American Association of Clinical Endocrinology protocol for guideline development. Recommendation Summary: This guideline includes 34 evidence-based clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of persons with NAFLD and/or NASH and contains 385 citations that inform the evidence base. Conclusion: NAFLD is a major public health problem that will only worsen in the future, as it is closely linked to the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given this link, endocrinologists and primary care physicians are in an ideal position to identify persons at risk on to prevent the development of cirrhosis and comorbidities. While no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved medications to treat NAFLD are currently available, management can include lifestyle changes that promote an energy deficit leading to weight loss; consideration of weight loss medications, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists; and bariatric surgery, for persons who have obesity, as well as some diabetes medications, such as pioglitazone and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and NASH. Management should also promote cardiometabolic health and reduce the increased cardiovascular risk associated with this complex disease.},

abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may lead to hepatic fibrosis. Dietary habits affect gut microbiota composition, whereas endotoxins produced by Gram-negative bacteria stimulate hepatic fibrogenesis. However, the mechanisms of action and the potential effect of microbiota in the liver are still unknown. Thus, we sought to analyze whether microbiota may interfere with liver fibrogenesis. Mice fed control (CTRL) or high-fat diet (HFD) were subjected to either bile duct ligation (BDL) or CCl4 treatment. Previously gut-sterilized mice were subjected to microbiota transplantation by oral gavage of cecum content obtained from donor CTRL- or HFD-treated mice. Fibrosis, intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, and serum endotoxemia were measured. Inflammasome components were evaluated in gut and liver. Microbiota composition (dysbiosis) was evaluated by Pyrosequencing. Fibrosis degree was increased in HFD+BDL versus CTRL+BDL mice, whereas no differences were observed between CTRL+CCl4 and HFD+CCl4 mice. Culture of mesenteric lymph nodes showed higher density of infection in HFD+BDL mice versus CTRL+BDL mice, suggesting higher bacterial translocation rate. Pyrosequencing revealed an increase in percentage of Gram-negative versus Gram-postive bacteria, a reduced ratio between Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, as well as a dramatic increase of Gram-negative Proteobacteria in HFD+BDL versus CTRL+BDL mice. Inflammasome expression was increased in liver of fibrotic mice, but significantly reduced in gut. Furthermore, microbiota transplantation revealed more liver damage in chimeric mice fed CTRL diet, but receiving the microbiota of HFD-treated mice; liver damage was further enhanced by transplantation of selected Gram-negative bacteria obtained from cecum content of HFD+BDL-treated mice. Conclusions: Dietary habits, by increasing the percentage of intestinal Gram-negative endotoxin producers, may accelerate liver fibrogenesis, introducing dysbiosis as a cofactor contributing to chronic liver injury in NAFLD. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.},

abstract = {Several animal studies have emphasized the role of gut microbiota in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, data about gut dysbiosis in human NAFLD remain scarce in the literature, especially studies including the whole spectrum of NAFLD lesions. We aimed to evaluate the association between gut dysbiosis and severe NAFLD lesions, that is, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, in a well-characterized population of adult NAFLD. Fifty-seven patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD were enrolled. Taxonomic composition of gut microbiota was determined using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of stool samples. Thirty patients had F0/F1 fibrosis stage at liver biopsy (10 with NASH), and 27 patients had significant F≥2 fibrosis (25 with NASH). Bacteroides abundance was significantly increased in NASH and F≥2 patients, whereas Prevotella abundance was decreased. Ruminococcus abundance was significantly higher in F≥2 patients. By multivariate analysis, Bacteroides abundance was independently associated with NASH and Ruminococcus with F≥2 fibrosis. Stratification according to the abundance of these two bacteria generated three patient subgroups with increasing severity of NAFLD lesions. Based on imputed metagenomic profiles, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways significantly related to NASH and fibrosis F≥2 were mostly related to carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. Conclusion: NAFLD severity associates with gut dysbiosis and a shift in metabolic function of the gut microbiota. We identified Bacteroides as independently associated with NASH and Ruminococcus with significant fibrosis. Thus, gut microbiota analysis adds information to classical predictors of NAFLD severity and suggests novel metabolic targets for pre-/probiotics therapies.},

abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in the United States and the world; with no Food and Drug Administration–approved pharmacological treatment available, it remains an area of unmet medical need. In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the most important predictor of clinical outcome is the fibrosis stage. Moreover, the Food and Drug Administration recommends that clinical trials for drugs to treat this disease include patients with fibrosis stage 2 or greater. Therefore, when using animal models for investigating the pathophysiology of NAFLD and for the preclinical evaluation of new drugs, it is important that the animals develop substantial fibrosis. The aim of this study was to develop a mouse model of NAFLD that replicated the disease in humans, including obesity and progressive liver fibrosis. Agouti yellow mutant mice, which have hyperphagia, were fed a Western diet and water containing high-fructose corn syrup for 16 weeks. Mice became obese and developed glucose intolerance. Their gut microbiota showed dysbiosis with changes that replicate some of the changes described in humans with NASH. They developed NASH with activity scores of 5–6 and fibrosis, which was stage 1 after 16 weeks, and stage 3 after 12 months. Changes in liver gene expression assessed by gene-set enrichment analysis showed 90% similarity with changes in human patients with NASH. Conclusion: Ay mice, when fed a Western diet similar to that consumed by humans, develop obesity and NASH with liver histology, including fibrosis, and gene expression changes that are highly similar to the disease in humans.},

abstract = {Despite evidence that the intestinal microbiota (IM) is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity, the IM composition of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been well characterized. This prospective, cross-sectional study was aimed at identifying differences in IM between adults with biopsy-proven NAFLD (simple steatosis [SS] or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]) and living liver donors as healthy controls (HC). Fifty subjects were included: 11 SS, 22 NASH, and 17 HC. One stool sample was collected from each participant. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure total bacterial counts, Bacteroides/Prevotella (herein referred to as Bacteroidetes), Clostridium leptum, C. coccoides, bifidobacteria, Escherichia coli and Archaea in stool. Clinical and laboratory data, food records, and activity logs were collected. Patients with NASH had a lower percentage of Bacteroidetes (Bacteroidetes to total bacteria counts) compared to both SS and HC (P = 0.006) and higher fecal C. coccoides compared to those with SS (P = 0.04). There were no differences in the remaining microorganisms. As body mass index (BMI) and dietary fat intake differed between the groups (P < 0.05), we performed linear regression adjusting for these variables. The difference in C. coccoides was no longer significant after adjusting for BMI and fat intake. However, there continued to be a significant association between the presence of NASH and lower percentage Bacteroidetes even after adjusting for these variables (P = 0.002; 95% confidence interval = -0.06 to -0.02). Conclusion:: There is an inverse and diet-/BMI-independent association between the presence of NASH and percentage Bacteroidetes in the stool, suggesting that the IM may play a role in the development of NAFLD. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.},

abstract = {Background: The use of prescription anti-obesity medication (AOM) is becoming increasingly common as treatment options grow and become more accessible. However, AOM may not be without a wide range of potentially negative impacts on patient functioning and well being. The Treatment Related Impact Measure (TRIM-Weight) is an obesity treatment-specific patient reported outcomes (PRO) measure designed to assess the key impacts of prescription anti-obesity medication. This paper will present the validation findings for the TRIM-Weight.Methods: The online validation battery survey was administered in four countries (the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada). Eligible subjects were over age eighteen, currently taking a prescription AOM and were currently or had been obese during their life. Validation analyses were conducted according to an a priori statistical analysis plan. Item level psychometric and conceptual criteria were used to refine and reduce the preliminary item pool and factor analysis to identify structural domains was performed. Reliability and validity testing was then performed and the minimally importance difference (MID) explored.Results: Two hundred and eight subjects completed the survey. Twenty-one of the 43 items were dropped and a five-factor structure was achieved: Daily Life, Weight Management, Treatment Burden, Experience of Side Effects, and Psychological Health. A-priori criteria for internal consistency and test-retest coefficients for the total score and all five subscales were met. All pre-specified hypotheses for convergent and known group validity were also met with the exception of the domain of Daily Life (proven in an ad hoc analysis) as well as the 1/2 standard deviation threshold for the MID.Conclusion: The development and validation of the TRIM-Weight has been conducted according to well-defined principles for the creation of a PRO measure. Based on the evidence to date, the TRIM-Weight can be considered a brief, conceptually sound, valid and reliable PRO measure. {\textcopyright} 2010 Brod et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Methods: This is a cross-sectional, population-based study including 949 adults 20 to 59 y of age living in the Vi{\c{c}}osa, Minas Gerais, Brazil - urban zone. The PhA was measured based on electrical bioimpedance analysis. The metabolic profile comprised the following components: waist circumference, glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non–HDL-C, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, homeostatic model assessment index–insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), serum uric acid, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. Linear regression models (crude and adjusted) were used to determine the association between each independent and dependent variable; statistical significance was analyzed at 5%. Results: Multiple analyses showed that the increase in the values of waist circumference ($\beta$: -0.01; 95%CI: -0.03; -0.01) represented lower values in the PhA. For the glucose, non-HDL-C, triglycerides, CRP, HOMA-IR and uric acid there was no association with PhA in the adjusted models. Conclusion: Low PhA was directly associated with grater values of the waist circumference, even after adjustments were made in the sociodemographic, lifestyle variables and body mass index; this outcome suggests that PhA is a promising cardiometabolic profile biomarker in adults.},

abstract = {Objective: ACTION (Awareness, Care, and Treatment in Obesity maNagement) examined obesity-related perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors among people with obesity (PwO), health care providers (HCPs), and employer representatives (ERs). Methods: A total of 3,008 adult PwO (BMI 30 by self-reported height and weight), 606 HCPs, and 153 ERs completed surveys in a cross-sectional design. Results: Despite several weight loss (WL) attempts, only 23% of PwO reported 10% WL during the previous 3 years. Many PwO (65%) recognized obesity as a disease, but only 54% worried their weight may affect future health. Most PwO (82%) felt "completely" responsible for WL; 72% of HCPs felt responsible for contributing to WL efforts; few ERs (18%) felt even partially responsible. Only 50% of PwO saw themselves as "obese," and 55% reported receiving a formal diagnosis of obesity. Despite HCPs' reported comfort with weight-related conversations, time constraints deprioritized these efforts. Only 24% of PwO had a scheduled follow-up to initial weight-related conversations. Few PwO (17%) perceived employer-sponsored wellness offerings as helpful in supporting WL. Conclusions: Although generally perceived as a disease, obesity is not commonly treated as such. Divergence in perceptions and attitudes potentially hinders better management. This study highlights inconsistent understanding of the impact of obesity and need for both self-directed and medical management.},

OBJECTIVE To summarize key guidelines in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition (PAG). PROCESS AND EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic review of the science supporting physical activity and health. The committee addressed 38 questions and 104 subquestions and graded the evidence based on consistency and quality of the research. Evidence graded as strong or moderate was the basis of the key guidelines. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) based the PAG on the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report. RECOMMENDATIONS The PAG provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity to improve a variety of health outcomes for multiple population groups. Preschool-aged children (3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. Children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Adults should do at least 150 minutes to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. They should also do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Pregnant and postpartum women should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Adults with chronic conditions or disabilities, who are able, should follow the key guidelines for adults and do both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Recommendations emphasize that moving more and sitting less will benefit nearly everyone. Individuals performing the least physical activity benefit most by even modest increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Additional benefits occur with more physical activity. Both aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity are beneficial. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition, provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide substantial health benefits. Health professionals and policy makers should facilitate awareness of the guidelines and promote the health benefits of physical activity and support efforts to implement programs, practices, and policies to facilitate increased physical activity and to improve the health of the US population.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to describe the face and discriminant validity of an exercise vital sign (EVS) for use in an outpatient electronic medical record. Methods: Eligible patients were 1,793,385 adults 18 yr and older who were members of a large health care system in Southern California. To determine face validity, median total self-reported minutes per week of exercise as measured by the EVS were compared with findings from national population-based surveys. To determine discriminant validity, multivariate Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation were used to examine the ability of the EVS to discriminate between groups of patients with differing physical activity (PA) levels on the basis of demographics and health status. Results: After 1.5 yr of implementation, 86% (1,537,798) of all eligible patients had an EVS in their electronic medical record. Overall, 36.3% of patients were completely inactive (0 min of exercise per week), 33.3% were insufficiently active (more than 0 but less than 150 min•wk), and 30.4% were sufficiently active (150 min or more per week). As compared with national population-based surveys, patient reports of PA were lower but followed similar patterns. As hypothesized, patients who were older, obese, of a racial/ethnic minority, and had higher disease burdens were more likely to be inactive, suggesting that the EVS has discriminant validity. ConclusionS: We found that the EVS has good face and discriminant validity and may provide more conservative estimates of PA behavior when compared with national surveys. The EVS has the potential to provide information about the relationship between exercise and health care use, cost, and chronic disease that has not been previously available at the population level.

abstract = {Introduction: Assessment and counseling by healthcare providers can successfully increase physical activity; however, a valid instrument to effectively measure physical activity is needed. This study examines the validity of the Exercise Vital Sign tool by comparing Exercise Vital Sign data collected at Kaiser Permanente Northwest with accelerometry data. Methods: Participants (n=521) completed accelerometer monitoring and had ≥1 Exercise Vital Sign measurement in their electronic medical record. Using accelerometry as the gold standard, the association between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity minutes per week estimated through Exercise Vital Sign and that estimated through accelerometry was examined using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Comparability of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity categories (inactive, lowly active, moderately active, sufficiently active) was assessed using simple and weighted $\kappa$ statistics. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. The study was conducted in 2012–2015, with analysis in 2019–2020. Results: Average accelerometry-based moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was 212 minutes per week, and 57% of the participants were considered sufficiently active. Exercise Vital Sign‒based moderate-to-vigorous physical activity averaged 170 minutes per week, and 53% of the participants were active. There was a positive correlation between the moderate-to-vigorous physical activity minutes per week reported through Exercise Vital Sign and that reported through accelerometry (r =0.38, p<0.0001). A fair agreement was observed between Exercise Vital Sign‒ and accelerometry-based moderate-to-vigorous physical activity categories (weighted $\kappa$=0.29), with the highest agreement occurring for those with physical activity level ≥150 minutes per week. The positive correlation increased when moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was examined dichotomously (<150 or ≥150 minutes per week, $\kappa$=0.34). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for Exercise Vital Sign (when compared with those of accelerometry) were 67%, 68%, 61%, and 73%, respectively. Conclusions: The Exercise Vital Sign is a useful physical activity assessment tool that correctly identifies the majority of adults who do and do not meet physical activity guidelines.},

abstract = {The increasing incidence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome is disturbing. The activation of inflammatory pathways, used normally as host defence, reminds the seriousness of this condition. There is probably more than one cause for activation of inflammation. Apparently, metabolic overload evokes stress reactions, such as oxidative, inflammatory, organelle and cell hypertrophy, generating vicious cycles. Adipocyte hypertrophy, through physical reasons, facilitates cell rupture, what will evoke an inflammatory reaction. Inability of adipose tissue development to engulf incoming fat leads to deposition in other organs, mainly in the liver, with consequences on insulin resistance. The oxidative stress which accompanies feeding, particularly when there is excessive ingestion of fat and/or other macronutrients without concomitant ingestion of antioxidant-rich foods/beverages, may contribute to inflammation attributed to obesity. Moreover, data on the interaction of microbiota with food and obesity brought new hypothesis for the obesity/fat diet relationship with inflammation. Beyond these, other phenomena, for instance psychological and/or circadian rhythm disturbances, may likewise contribute to oxidative/inflammatory status. The difficulty in the management of obesity/metabolic syndrome is linked to their multifactorial nature where environmental, genetic and psychosocial factors interact through complex networks.

abstract = {Several lines of preclinical and clinical research have confirmed that chronic low-grade inflammation of adipose tissue is mechanistically linked to metabolic disease and organ tissue complications in the overweight and obese organism. Despite this widely confirmed paradigm, numerous open questions and knowledge gaps remain to be investigated. This is mainly due to the intricately intertwined cross-talk of various pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling cascades involved in the immune response of expanding adipose depots, particularly the visceral adipose tissue. Adipose tissue inflammation is initiated and sustained over time by dysfunctional adipocytes that secrete inflammatory adipokines and by infiltration of bone marrow-derived immune cells that signal via production of cytokines and chemokines. Despite its low-grade nature, adipose tissue inflammation negatively impacts remote organ function, a phenomenon that is considered causative of the complications of obesity. The aim of this review is to broadly present an overview of adipose tissue inflammation by highlighting the most recent reports in the scientific literature and summarizing our overall understanding of the field. We also discuss key endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators and analyze their mechanistic role(s) in the pathogenesis and treatment of adipose tissue inflammation. In doing so, we hope to stimulate studies to uncover novel physiological, cellular, and molecular targets for the treatment of obesity.},

abstract = {Purpose: There is growing evidence that inflammation is a central and reversible mechanism through which obesity promotes cancer risk and progression. Methods: We review recent findings regarding obesity-associated alterations in the microenvironment and the local and systemic mechanisms through which these changes support tumor growth. Results: Locally, hyperadiposity is associated with altered adipose tissue function, adipocyte death, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Most individuals who are obese harbor inflamed adipose tissue, which resembles chronically injured tissue, with immune cell infiltration and remodeling. Within this distinctly altered local environment, several pathophysiologic changes are found that may promote breast and other cancers. Consistently, adipose tissue inflammation is associated with a worse prognosis in patients with breast and tongue cancers. Systemically, the metabolic syndrome, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, occurs in the setting of adipose inflammation and operates in concert with local mechanisms to sustain the inflamed microenvironment and promote tumor growth. Importantly, adipose inflammation and its protumor consequences can be found in some individuals who are not considered to be obese or overweight by body mass index. Conclusion: The tumor-promoting effects of obesity occur at the local level via adipose inflammation and associated alterations in the microenvironment, as well as systemically via circulating metabolic and inflammatory mediators associated with adipose inflammation. Accurately characterizing the obese state and identifying patients at increased risk for cancer development and progression will likely require more precise assessments than body mass index alone. Biomarkers of adipose tissue inflammation would help to identify high-risk populations. Moreover, adipose inflammation is a reversible process and represents a novel therapeutic target that warrants further study to break the obesity-cancer link.},

Understanding causal mechanisms by which obesity drives cancer initiation and progression is essential for the development of novel precision therapy for obese cancer patients. One caveat is that various mechanisms have been proposed for different cancer types for their progression under obesity. Since obesity is known to have global impact on inflammation, here we will summarize recent literature and discuss the potential of inflammation being the common causal mechanism to promote cancer promotion across cancer types.},

The biological basis of disease is one avenue for further exploration in this context. Several key inflammatory markers have been consistently associated with both obesity and risk of adverse outcomes in obesity-associated diseases, which suggests that a persistent, low-grade, inflammatory response is a potentially modifiable risk factor. In this Review, we provide evidence supporting perturbation of the intestinal microbiota and changes in intestinal permeability as potential triggers of inflammation in obesity. Further characterisation of the mechanisms underpinning the triggers of such inflammatory responses in overweight and obese individuals could offer unique opportunities for intervention strategies to help ameliorate the risk of obesity-associated disease.},

abstract = {Importance: Cancer and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are now widely recognized as a threat to global development. The latest United Nations high-level meeting on NCDs reaffirmed this observation and also highlighted the slow progress in meeting the 2011 Political Declaration on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases and the third Sustainable Development Goal. Lack of situational analyses, priority setting, and budgeting have been identified as major obstacles in achieving these goals. All of these have in common that they require information on the local cancer epidemiology. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study is uniquely poised to provide these crucial data. Objective: To describe cancer burden for 29 cancer groups in 195 countries from 1990 through 2017 to provide data needed for cancer control planning. Evidence Review: We used the GBD study estimation methods to describe cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-Adjusted life-years (DALYs). Results are presented at the national level as well as by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator of income, educational attainment, and total fertility rate. We also analyzed the influence of the epidemiological vs the demographic transition on cancer incidence. Findings: In 2017, there were 24.5 million incident cancer cases worldwide (16.8 million without nonmelanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) and 9.6 million cancer deaths. The majority of cancer DALYs came from years of life lost (97%), and only 3% came from years lived with disability. The odds of developing cancer were the lowest in the low SDI quintile (1 in 7) and the highest in the high SDI quintile (1 in 2) for both sexes. In 2017, the most common incident cancers in men were NMSC (4.3 million incident cases); tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer (1.5 million incident cases); and prostate cancer (1.3 million incident cases). The most common causes of cancer deaths and DALYs for men were TBL cancer (1.3 million deaths and 28.4 million DALYs), liver cancer (572000 deaths and 15.2 million DALYs), and stomach cancer (542000 deaths and 12.2 million DALYs). For women in 2017, the most common incident cancers were NMSC (3.3 million incident cases), breast cancer (1.9 million incident cases), and colorectal cancer (819000 incident cases). The leading causes of cancer deaths and DALYs for women were breast cancer (601000 deaths and 17.4 million DALYs), TBL cancer (596000 deaths and 12.6 million DALYs), and colorectal cancer (414000 deaths and 8.3 million DALYs). Conclusions and Relevance: The national epidemiological profiles of cancer burden in the GBD study show large heterogeneities, which are a reflection of different exposures to risk factors, economic settings, lifestyles, and access to care and screening. The GBD study can be used by policy makers and other stakeholders to develop and improve national and local cancer control in order to achieve the global targets and improve equity in cancer care.},

abstract = {The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide in the past $\sim$50 years, reaching pandemic levels. Obesity represents a major health challenge because it substantially increases the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, fatty liver disease, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, dementia, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnoea and several cancers, thereby contributing to a decline in both quality of life and life expectancy. Obesity is also associated with unemployment, social disadvantages and reduced socio-economic productivity, thus increasingly creating an economic burden. Thus far, obesity prevention and treatment strategies — both at the individual and population level — have not been successful in the long term. Lifestyle and behavioural interventions aimed at reducing calorie intake and increasing energy expenditure have limited effectiveness because complex and persistent hormonal, metabolic and neurochemical adaptations defend against weight loss and promote weight regain. Reducing the obesity burden requires approaches that combine individual interventions with changes in the environment and society. Therefore, a better understanding of the remarkable regional differences in obesity prevalence and trends might help to identify societal causes of obesity and provide guidance on which are the most promising intervention strategies.},

According to the World Health Organization report, 1.5 billion adults were overweight, over 500 million of them were obese, and the prevalence of obesity is expected to rise in the years to come. A similar situation is recorded in Croatia, where there are 25.3% of obese men and 34.1% of obese women. There are multiple factors that cause obesity. Accelerated lifestyle, fast food, unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyle are considered as the major risk factors of overweight and obesity development. Accumulation of fat tissue, especially visceral fat tissue has been demonstrated to be associated with some chronic changes and diseases of different organ systems. Some anthropometric measurements, especially body mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio, have been used to diagnose obesity and estimate the health risk. Developing well-structured prevention programs that would encourage people to become aware of obesity as a disease and that imbalanced dietary habits and physical activity are important for obesity prevention and health, is a major public health challenge.},

She presented with altered of consciousness, horizontal nystagmus, and gait disturbance, and acute deterioration of consciousness was observed after starting peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN). Brain MRI showed bilateral high intensity lesions in the medial thalamus and the dorsal midbrain on FLAIR and T2-weighted images. Although brain MRI characteristics are useful for diagnosing WE. it is possible that there are no abnormal MRI findings in its early stages. In addition, only 10-20% of WE cases present with the classical clinical triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. Therefore, confirming the diagnosis can be challenging. In general, rapid improvement of symptoms is observed with prompt vitamin B1 supplementation. However, delays in treatment can result in irreversible amnesia and ataxia. Furthermore, in the state of vitamin B1 deficiency, even PPN, not just total parenteral nutrition, can worsen symptoms, and this deterioration is attributed to the glucose load.},

@article{Hahn1998,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is an acute neurologic disorder characterized by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and mental confusion. WE is attributable to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Beriberi is the systemic counterpart of thiamine deficiency and often manifests in cardiovascular collapse. WE is usually associated with alcoholism and malnutrition. It has also been seen in people with gastrointestinal diseases with malabsorption. Patients who have received total parenteral nutrition (TPN) without proper replacement of thiamine have also developed WE. Since November 1996, there has been a shortage of multivitamin infusion (MVI). Many patients who were on chronic TPN with MVI ceased to receive the MVI and were converted to an oral form of the multivitamin. As a result, there have been several reports of children and adults on TPN who have developed WE as a result of thiamine deficiency. With this case report, we bring to attention the association of the MVI shortage and WE. Early diagnosis of WE is important, because if it is treated with thiamine in the acute stages, the neurologic and cardiovascular abnormalities can be reversed. CASE REPORT: We report a 20-year-old female patient with Crohn's disease who developed WE as a result of thiamine deficiency. She had Crohn's disease since age 9 years and was on chronic TPN. Two months before admission, MVI was discontinued in the TPN because of the shortage of its supply. An oral multivitamin tablet was substituted instead. She was admitted to the hospital for persistent vomiting. In the hospital, she continued to receive TPN without MVI, but continued taking an oral multivitamin preparation. Two weeks after admission, she developed signs of WE including diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and memory disturbance. She also developed hypotension that was thought to be caused by beriberi. She was treated with 50 mg of intravenous thiamine. Within hours of the intravenous thiamine, her hypotension resolved. The day after the infusion, she no longer complained of diplopia, and her ophthalmoplegia had improved dramatically. Magnetic resonance imaging showed several areas of abnormally high signal on T2-weighted images in the brainstem, thalamus, and mamillary bodies. The topographic distribution of these changes was typical of WE. After 2 months, her mental status and neurologic status had recovered completely. CONCLUSION: WE and thiamine deficiency should be considered in all patients with malabsorption, malnutrition, and malignancies. WE from thiamine deficiency can occur as a result of cessation of MVI in the TPN infusion. Even if an oral multivitamin preparation is given instead of MVI, patients with malabsorption may not absorb thiamine adequately. Prompt diagnosis of WE is important because it is potentially fatal and readily treatable with thiamine supplementation. Early recognition of WE may be more difficult in children, because the classic triad of symptoms may not develop fully. Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in these cases to confirm the diagnosis of WE. Because the shortage of MVI is expected to be a long-term, there are likely to be more cases of WE in the pediatric population of TPN-dependent children. Because there is no shortage of intravenous thiamine, it should be administered with TPN even if MVI is not available.},

Patients with acute WE generally present with the classic clinical triad of inattentiveness, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. We describe a patient who presented with acute WE at 2 months after laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Initial MRI of the brain demonstrated the characteristic injuries of WE, and repeat imaging showed resolution after 4 months of thiamine supplementation, at which time the patient had normal gait but persistent memory deficits. Even with early recognition and aggressive therapy, acute WE commonly results in permanent disability due to the irreversible cytotoxic effects on specific regions of the brain. Since the clinical onset of acute WE follows a predictable time-course in post-bariatric surgery patients with malnutrition, we recommend prevention by administration of parenteral thiamine beginning at 6 weeks postoperatively in malnourished patients.},

Eleven days after her last treatment, she developed acute diplopia, deafness and gait ataxia, followed by severe confusion. She became markedly acidotic and hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 60 mmHg, necessitating intubation, dopamine treatment and hemodialysis for 7 h. She was also given thiamine. Thereafter, her blood pressure stabilized, the acidosis improved, and her deafness, diplopia, and confusion were resolved.

Because Wernicke's encephalopathy is suspected to be underdiagnosed in children, the authors wished to assess the frequency of overlooked diagnosis and to establish pertinent findings that could lead to early identification of pediatric Wernicke's encephalopathy. The authors performed multiple literature searches seeking pediatric patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy (age = 20 years or younger). A total of 30 patients was found, and the authors added a new patient. Each case report had its clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data, diagnostic method, and outcome analyzed. Of 31 patients, 16 were female and 15 male; the median age ± S.D. was 11 ± 6.5 years. The most frequent underlying disorder was malignancy in 11. Thirteen patients died undiagnosed, 16 recovered with thiamine therapy (eight with sequelae), and two died of infection soon after thiamine replacement was initiated. Only six presented with the Wernicke's encephalopathy clinical triad (mental status changes, ocular signs, and ataxia) at neurologic onset; nine eventually demonstrated this triad. The high rate of patients diagnosed only at postmortem examination (41.9%) confirms that Wernicke's encephalopathy is underdiagnosed in children. Thiamine therapy is warranted if any component of the Wernicke's encephalopathy triad is present in an appropriate clinical setting.},

We report 4 nonalcoholic patients with such Wernicke's encephalopathy, which occurred during the early postoperative oral food intake period following intravenous nutrition without vitamin supplements. We analyzed the medical records of 4 patients, 3 men and 1 woman, aged between 55 and 71 years, who were admitted to our hospital between 1992 and 1995. Three patients underwent gastrointestinal surgery and 1 suffered chronic pyothorax. We diagnosed our patients as having Wernicke's encephalopathy based on typical neurological abnormalities, in addition to typical cranial magnetic resonance image findings, low serum vitamin B1 levels, or both. Although all of the patients were treated with vitamin B1 and showed some improvement, 1 patient developed Korsakoff syndrome, 2 made incomplete neurological recovery, and 1 died. We speculated that the body vitamin B1 stores had been decreasing in our patients who did not receive any vitamin supplements during intravenous hyperalimentation or hydration. Subsequent administration of high calorie and high carbohydrate oral diets increased the demand for vitamin B1, further depleting the vitamin stores, thereby causing 'iatrogenic' Wernicke's encephalopathy. The change of our national health insurance policy in 1992 discouraged the routine administration of vitamins, probably causing Wernicke's encephalopathy in our patients. Copyright (C) 2000 S.

Wernicke's encephalopathy is described in alcoholism, in hyperemesis gravidarum, and in prolonged IV feeding without vitamin supplementation. Methods: We report a case of a 66-year-old man undergoing surgery for acute necrotic-hemorrhagic pancreatitis, who presented a Wernicke's syndrome during parenteral nutrition (PN). After surgery, he was treated with infusion of industrial 3-compartment bags, without vitamin supplementation. On the seventh postoperative day, nausea and vomiting began, and 5 days later the patient showed diplopia, ataxia, general muscular stiffness, reduction of osteotendinous reflexes, confusional state, and thrombocytopenia. The magnetic resonance scan evidenced pathologic changes in the medial thalamus, in the third and fourth ventricular floor, in the cerebellar vermis, and in the periaqueductal gray substance. Results: All neurologic signs and platelet blood count gradually normalized after IV supplementation of thiamine, 100 mg daily. The magnetic resonance scan repeated 40 days after the first one was normal. Conclusions: Our report points out the risk of incorrect procedures in management of industrial 3-compartment bags. Moreover, we suggest that thrombocytopenia may be related to thiamine deficiency. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.},

abstract = {Selective cerebral vulnerability is a major consequence of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE), in which focal areas of the brain exhibit symmetrical profound neuronal loss and accompanying gliosis, occurring most frequently in diencephalic regions such as the thalamus and the mammillary bodies. Many processes have been proposed to explain the selective cerebral vulnerability and the focal neuronal cell death in Wernicke's encephalopathy. There are several mechanisms which are common to the pathophysiology of encephalopathies caused by thiamine deficiency (TD). Recently, emphasis is being placed on deficit in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays major roles in regulating brain damage and inflammation.Here we present two fatal cases of non-alcohol associated WE. The immunohistochemical study revealed increased proinflammatory cytokine immunoreactivity in the neurons of the mammillary bodies and medial thalamus, and in the periaqueductal regions, compared with basal constitutive levels of expression in the frontal cortex. Positive (WE cases) and negative (immediate trauma deaths) case-controls were used to confirm the results. TD induced IL-1$\beta$ proteins weakly, while moderate increase was observed for TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6. Immunofluorescence analysis by confocal microscopy confirmed the staining results for immunoreactivity in WE brains. Further, the induction of proinflammatory cytokine protein expression levels was quantified by Western blot analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although Wernicke encephalopathy has been reported in the oncological literature, it has not previously been reported in postoperative cancer patients. METHODS: In this communication, we report a patient of hepatocellular carcinoma with liver cirrhosis who developed Wernicke encephalopathy in the form of postoperative delirium. Preoperatively, the patient had a very good appetite and had eaten all the food of an 1800 cal/day diet until 1 day before operation. The operation was done without any complications. The patient developed delirium 2 days after the lobectomy of the liver. The level of delirium remained unchanged until administration of thiamine starting on day 7 postoperatively, which resulted in palliation of delirium without brain damage. Laboratory data demonstrated that the serum thiamine level at day 6 postoperatively was below the lower limit of normal. As the mechanism of Wernicke encephalopathy, we thought that decreased ability to store thiamine due to liver cirrhosis led to depletion of thiamine faster than had been expected. RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESEARCH: In cancer patients, clinicians must always remain aware of the possibility of Wernicke encephalopathy, especially in patients with liver dysfunction, which decreases the ability to store thiamine in the liver. Early detection and intervention may alleviate the symptoms of delirium and prevent irreversible brain damage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wernicke encephalopathy is rare in children and is caused by thiamine deficiency. It is characterized by acute or subacute ataxia, altered consciousness, and ophthalmoparesis. Gastroenterological surgery, total parenteral nutrition for short bowel syndrome, and alcoholism are common risk factors for Wernicke encephalopathy. Typical magnetic resonance imaging features include selective symmetrical signal changes in the mammillary bodies, medial thalamus, tectum, periaqueductal region, cranial nerves, cerebellum, red nucleus, dentate nucleus, fornix, splenium, cerebral cortex, and putamen. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the disease may be fatal. PATIENT DESCRIPTION: We describe a 13-year-old boy who developed acute cerebellar findings while receiving total parenteral nutrition after gastroduodenostomy for duodenal stenosis. RESULTS: The diagnosis of Wernicke encephalopathy was based on his clinical history, neurological examination, and imaging results. We immediately started intravenous thiamine replacement therapy. Two weeks later, the patient's clinical signs had resolved except for mild clumsiness, which was observed during his tandem gait examination. CONCLUSION: Our report emphasizes the importance of clinical and magnetic resonance imaging pattern recognition in timely diagnosis, as well as the importance of prompt thiamine replacement therapy. We also demonstrate the importance of thiamine supplementation during total parenteral nutrition after gastrointestinal surgery.},

abstract = {Objective: Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is an acute disorder due to thiamine deficiency, characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and mental confusion, similar to that classically observed in alcoholism. Some cases of WE were reported to coincide with other conditions such as hyperemesis gravidarum, bariatric surgery, and total parenteral nutrition. In this study the objective was to retrospectively evaluate the prevalence of WE among intravenously fed patients in our hospital during the previous 2 y. Methods: Among all cases of WE diagnosed by cranial magnetic resonance scan during a 2-y period in the Azienda Ospedaliera of Padua, we identified patients who exhibited WE during parenteral feeding. Albumin plasma levels, measured at the onset of WE symptoms, were used to estimate nutritional status. Results: We found seven cases of WE that coincided with intravenous feeding. WE occurred, on average, 13 d after the start of glucose infusion. The five subjects with albumin plasma levels lower than 35 g/L at the onset of WE received glucose infusion for fewer days. In six cases the clinical signs disappeared the day after thiamine infusion. In one case mental function did not normalize and the patient developed Korsakoff's syndrome despite prolonged thiamine treatment. Conclusion: During a 2-y period we observed a high prevalence of WE in intravenously fed patients due to lack of thiamine supplementation. A prophylactic treatment must be performed in at-risk patients and multivitamin infusion containing thiamine must be administered daily during the course of intravenous feeding. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyperemesis gravidarum complicates 0.5-2.0% of pregnancies and may lead to substantial nutritional deficiencies. Total parenteral nutrition can be used in severe cases in an attempt to avoid such deficiencies. Rarely, thiamine deficiency resulting in Wernicke encephalopathy occurs, with significant maternal morbidity. CASE: We present the case of a 30-year-old woman with hyperemesis gravidarum at 13 4/7 weeks of gestation treated with prolonged total parenteral nutrition that lacked thiamine supplementation, resulting in iatrogenic Wernicke encephalopathy. After high-dose intravenous thiamine repletion, she experienced slow resolution of her symptoms. CONCLUSION: Pregnancies complicated by hyperemesis gravidarum treated with total parenteral nutrition represent potential high-risk clinical scenarios for thiamine deficiency. Compositions of total parenteral nutrition are not standardized. Thus, physicians must confirm repletion of all essential components to avoid significant morbidity.},

abstract = {Nutrition support practitioners are currently dealing with shortages of parenteral nutrition micronutrients, including multivitamins (MVI), selenium and zinc. A recent survey from the American Society of Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition (ASPEN) indicates that this shortage is having a profound effect on clinical practice. A majority of respondents reported taking some aggressive measures to ration existing supplies. Most premature infants and many infants with congenital anomalies are dependent on parenteral nutrition for the first weeks of life to meet nutritional needs. Because of fragile health and poor reserves, they are uniquely susceptible to this problem. It should be understood that shortages and rationing have been associated with adverse outcomes, such as lactic acidosis and Wernicke encephalopathy from thiamine deficiency or pulmonary and skeletal development concerns related to inadequate stores of Vitamin A and D. In this review, we will discuss the current parenteral shortages and the possible impact on a population of very low birth weight infants. This review will also present a case study of a neonate who was impacted by these current shortages. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Parenteral nutrition, vitamin supplementation and high-dosed intravenous thiamine supplementation were initiated. After 14 days, the patient started to develop acute respiratory failure, and neurological functions were impaired. Blood values showed significant electrolyte disturbances. RFS was diagnosed and managed according to the NICE guidelines. After 14 days, phosphate levels had returned to normal range, and neurological symptoms were improved. Conclusion: Extreme weight loss following obesity surgery has been shown to be associated with undernutrition. These patients are at high risk for evolving RFS, even though they may still be obese. Awareness of RFS as a postsurgical complication, the identification of patients at risk as well as prevention and correct management should be routinely performed at every bariatric center.},

abstract = {Background: Thiamine plays a critical role in energy metabolism. Critically ill patients may have thiamine deficiency and increased mortality due to potentially irreversible consequences. The aim of this study was to show the impact of thiamine deficiency in a series of patients and the rapid response to thiamine replacement, showing the changes in clinical and metabolic conditions over time. Methods: We described 3 cases of hospitalized patients who had received parenteral nutrition (PN) without vitamin supplementation. All the patients were admitted to the ICU between 2010 and 2011 with a severe form of lactic acidosis, an unstable circulatory state, and a different neurological disorder (a lethargic state, a severe form of impaired near-coma consciousness, and Wernicke encephalopathy). Results: Intravenous (IV) administration of thiamine was associated with a rapid and marked restoration of acid-base balance, hemodynamic stability and the disappearance of neurological disturbances, and normalization of the clinical and biochemical conditions of all the patients within the following hours. Conclusions: The 3 cases demonstrated the rapidity of the reversal of severe thiamine deficiency, achieved by appropriate replacement in different hospitalized patients. The regression of clinical and biochemical disorders requires a prompt diagnosis and treatment based on the IV administration of thiamine and magnesium sulfate. In hospitalized patients at risk, thiamine deficiency is prevented by the integration of thiamine supplementation into PN and other forms of nutrition support.},

It consists of malabsorption caused by a congenital short bowel or extensive resection of a large part of the small intestine.

Delayed treatment may lead to irreversible neuron necrosis, gliosis, severe amnesia, Korsakoff psy-chosis, or even death. We report the case of a premature infant with extremely low birth weight and short bowel syndrome. He was treated with early enteral nutrition combined with succus entericus reinfusion with no complications. Four months after discharge, he was diagnosed with Wernicke encephalopathy. He was treated with intrave-nous vitamin B1 (100 mg IV/d) and was administered oral vitamin B1 (20 mg 3 times daily) by his wet nurse. Vitamin B1 levels returned to normal after 4 days (69.8 nmol/L).

abstract = {Background: Wernicke's encephalopathy is a critical condition of neurological dysfunction resulting from a deficiency in thiamine. Chronic alcoholism is recognized as the most common cause of Wernicke's encephalopathy, but other causes, including fasting/starvation and malnutrition, have been documented within the scientific literature. These causes may not be readily recognized by healthcare professionals and may lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy being overlooked as a diagnosis when a nonalcoholic patient presents with classic signs and symptoms of the disorder. Materials and Methods: A narrative review of thiamine and its relationship to the development, diagnosis, and treatment of Wernicke's encephalopathy is presented based on a review of evidence-based guidelines and published research. To heighten awareness of the development of Wernicke's encephalopathy in fasted/starved and malnourished patients and to contribute to the scientific body of knowledge for the identification and management of Wernicke's encephalopathy in these patients, the clinical course and treatment of an adult woman who developed Wernicke's encephalopathy following a 40-day water-only fasting diet is outlined. Results: Clinical suspicion was required to identify the patient's condition and initiate immediate intervention through parenteral thiamine administration. Oral thiamine supplementation of 100 to 800 mg per day for 6 months was required to aid recovery. Outcomes: The patient's clinical course and response to treatment illustrate the necessity for clinical awareness and suspicion of Wernicke's encephalopathy among healthcare professionals, timely and adequate parenteral thiamine administration, and oral thiamine supplementation at therapeutic doses to correct the nutrient deficiency, halt the progression of Wernicke's encephalopathy, and promote recovery.},

abstract = {Objective: Background: Case Report: Conclusions: Challenging differential diagnosis Beriberi due to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency has two clinical presentations. Patients with dry beriberi present with neuropathy, and patients with wet beriberi present with heart failure, with or without neuropathy. Dry beriberi can mimic the most common form of Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome (GBS), an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP). Severe thiamine deficiency results in Wernicke's encephalopathy. This report of a case of dry beriberi and Wernicke's encephalopathy due to thiamine deficiency includes a review of the literature. A 56-year old woman with a history of gallstone pancreatitis and protein-calorie malnutrition was treated six months previously with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She initially presented at another hospital with paresthesia of the lower limbs, arms, and neck, and symptoms of encephalopathy. Initial diagnosis of GBS was made, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings. Despite five days of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment, her encephalopathy worsened, requiring transfer to our hospital, where she required intubation and treatment with vasopressors. A repeat MRI of her brain showed changes consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy. Following treatment with high-dose intravenous thiamine, her mental status improved within 48 hours, and by the third hospital day, she no longer required intubation. Symptoms and signs of dry beriberi due to thiamine deficiency can mimic those of acute or chronic GBS. However, thiamine repletion leads to rapid clinical improvement and can prevent irreversible neurologic sequelae, including Korsakoff syndrome. Clinicians should consider thiamine deficiency in malnourished patients presenting with symptoms and signs of GBS.},

The correlation between following a Ketogenic diet and acquiring Wernicke's, however, has not previously been reported. CASE REPORT: A 16-year-old previously healthy male presented with an eleven-day history of neurological deficits and GI upset. The patient had recently lost one hundred pounds while following a 'ketogenic' diet. He was subsequently diagnosed with Wernicke's, received intravenous thiamine, and was transferred to the inpatient rehabilitation, where he received extensive diet education. After making significant functional improvement, he was discharged home. RELEVANCE: This case illustrates the importance of including Wernicke's in the differential diagnosis when a pediatric patient presents with neurological deficits after rapid weight loss. Wernicke's encephalopathy may be fatal in the pediatric population, therefore, it must be treated immediately if clinically suspected. Children presenting with Wernicke's would benefit from early intervention, intensive inpatient rehabilitation, and comprehensive education regarding the role of food and exercise on weight loss and health.},

abstract = {The Human Microbiome Project used rigorous good clinical practice standards to complete comprehensive body site sampling in healthy 18-to 40-yr-old adults, creating an unparalleled reference set of microbiome specimens. To ensure that specimens represented minimally perturbed microbiomes, we first screened potential participants using exclusion criteria based on health history, including the presence of systemic diseases (e.g., hypertension, cancer, or immu-nodeficiency or autoimmune disorders), use of potential immunomodulators, and recent use of antibiotics or probiotics. Subsequent physical examinations excluded individuals based on body mass index (BMI), cutaneous lesions, and oral health. We screened 554 individuals to enroll 300 (149 men and 151 women, mean age 26 yr, mean BMI 24 kg/m 2 , 20.0% racial minority, and 10.7% Hispanic). We obtained specimens from the oral cavity, nares, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina (15 specimens from men and 18 from women). The study evaluated longitudinal changes in an individual's microbiome by sampling 279 participants twice (mean 212 d after the first sampling; range 30-359 d) and 100 individuals 3 times (mean 72 d after the second sampling; range 30-224 d). This sampling strategy yielded 11,174 primary specimens, from which 12,479 DNA samples were submitted to 4 centers for metagenomic sequencing. Our clinical design and well-defined reference cohort has laid a foundation for microbiome research.-Aagaard, K.,},

The system uses a hierarchically arranged database of food descriptions. A user identifies a consumed food by traversing a hierarchy and reaching a leaf node food item via a succession of selections from menu displays. If a food contains ingredients or was cooked with additional fat or salt, multiple traversals of the food hierarchies are necessary. The system assigns one or more food codes and determines the gram weight of the food consumed using everyday measures such as cups, slices, ounces, etc. It then uses these food codes and gram weights to calculate nutrient content.

abstract = {Infant microbiome assembly has been intensely studied in infants from industrialized nations, but little is known about this process in nonindustrialized populations. We deeply sequenced infant stool samples from the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania and analyzed them in a global meta-analysis. Infant microbiomes develop along lifestyle-associated trajectories, with more than 20% of genomes detected in the Hadza infant gut representing novel species. Industrialized infants—even those who are breastfed—have microbiomes characterized by a paucity of Bifidobacterium infantis and gene cassettes involved in human milk utilization. Strains within lifestyle-associated taxonomic groups are shared between mother-infant dyads, consistent with early life inheritance of lifestyle-shaped microbiomes. The population-specific differences in infant microbiome composition and function underscore the importance of studying microbiomes from people outside of wealthy, industrialized nations. Humans living an urbanized lifestyle in industrialized countries tend to have less diverse microbiota than people living more rural existences. Using fecal 16 S ribosomal RNA sequencing, Olm et al . found that after the first 6 months of life, the microbiome of infants living in contrasting environments diverged from Bifidobacteria -dominated assemblages. Deep metagenomic sequencing revealed that a large proportion of the bacterial species detected in samples from hunter-gatherer infants were new and were undetectable in samples from urbanized children. Gut microbiota diversity appears early in the lives of hunter-gatherer infants and is traceable to maternal transmission, with some influence from the local environment. The main driver for differences among gut microbiota originates in lifestyle rather than geography. It is suspected, but still enigmatic, that such differences in microbiota have functional implications for the health of developing children. —CA Global comparison of infant gut microbiota assembly shows systematic divergences depending on lifestyle.},

abstract = {Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been implicated in symptoms associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), though mechanisms remain poorly defined and treatment involves non-specific antibiotics. Here we show that SIBO based on duodenal aspirate culture reflects an overgrowth of anaerobes, does not correspond with patient symptoms, and may be a result of dietary preferences. Small intestinal microbial composition, on the other hand, is significantly altered in symptomatic patients and does not correspond with aspirate culture results. In a pilot interventional study we found that switching from a high fiber diet to a low fiber, high simple sugar diet triggered FGID-related symptoms and decreased small intestinal microbial diversity while increasing small intestinal permeability. Our findings demonstrate that characterizing small intestinal microbiomes in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms may allow a more targeted antibacterial or a diet-based approach to treatment.},

abstract = {Background: Despite the rising popularity of plant-based alternative meats, there is limited evidence of the health effects of these products. Objectives: We aimed to compare the effect of consuming plant-based alternative meat (Plant) as opposed to animal meat (Animal) on health factors. The primary outcome was fasting serum trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Secondary outcomes included fasting insulin-like growth factor 1, lipids, glucose, insulin, blood pressure, and weight. Methods: SWAP-MEAT (The Study With Appetizing Plantfood - Meat Eating Alternatives Trial) was a single-site, randomized crossover trial with no washout period. Participants received Plant and Animal products, dietary counseling, lab assessments, microbiome assessments (16S), and anthropometric measurements. Participants were instructed to consume ≥2 servings/d of Plant compared with Animal for 8 wk each, while keeping all other foods and beverages as similar as possible between the 2 phases. Results: The 36 participants who provided complete data for both crossover phases included 67% women, were 69% Caucasian, had a mean ± SD age 50 ± 14 y, and BMI 28 ± 5 kg/m2. Mean ± SD servings per day were not different by intervention sequence: 2.5 ± 0.6 compared with 2.6 ± 0.7 for Plant and Animal, respectively (P = 0.76). Mean ± SEM TMAO concentrations were significantly lower overall for Plant (2.7 ± 0.3) than for Animal (4.7 ± 0.9) (P = 0.012), but a significant order effect was observed (P = 0.023). TMAO concentrations were significantly lower for Plant among the n = 18 who received Plant second (2.9 ± 0.4 compared with 6.4 ± 1.5, Plant compared with Animal, P = 0.007), but not for the n = 18 who received Plant first (2.5 ± 0.4 compared with 3.0 ± 0.6, Plant compared with Animal, P = 0.23). Exploratory analyses of the microbiome failed to reveal possible responder compared with nonresponder factors. Mean ± SEM LDL-cholesterol concentrations (109.9 ± 4.5 compared with 120.7 ± 4.5 mg/dL, P = 0.002) and weight (78.7 ± 3.0 compared with 79.6 ± 3.0 kg, P < 0.001) were lower during the Plant phase. Conclusions: Among generally healthy adults, contrasting Plant with Animal intake, while keeping all other dietary components similar, the Plant products improved several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including TMAO; there were no adverse effects on risk factors from the Plant products.

abstract = {Diet modulates the gut microbiome, which in turn can impact the immune system. Here, we determined how two microbiota-targeted dietary interventions, plant-based fiber and fermented foods, influence the human microbiome and immune system in healthy adults. Using a 17-week randomized, prospective study (n = 18/arm) combined with -omics measurements of microbiome and host, including extensive immune profiling, we found diet-specific effects. The high-fiber diet increased microbiome-encoded glycan-degrading carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) despite stable microbial community diversity. Although cytokine response score (primary outcome) was unchanged, three distinct immunological trajectories in high-fiber consumers corresponded to baseline microbiota diversity. Alternatively, the high-fermented-food diet steadily increased microbiota diversity and decreased inflammatory markers. The data highlight how coupling dietary interventions to deep and longitudinal immune and microbiome profiling can provide individualized and population-wide insight. Fermented foods may be valuable in countering the decreased microbiome diversity and increased inflammation pervasive in industrialized society.},

abstract = {With the rising rates of obesity and associated metabolic disorders, there is a growing need for effective long-term weight-loss strategies, coupled with an understanding of how they interface with human physiology. Interest is growing in the potential role of gut microbes as they pertain to responses to different weight-loss diets; however, the ways that diet, the gut microbiota, and long-term weight loss influence one another is not well understood. Objectives: Our primary objective was to determine if baseline microbiota composition or diversity was associated with weight-loss success. A secondary objective was to track the longitudinal associations of changes to lower-carbohydrate or lower-fat diets and concomitant weight loss with the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota. Methods: We used 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing to profile microbiota composition over a 12-mo period in 49 participants as part of a larger randomized dietary intervention study of participants consuming either a healthy low-carbohydrate or a healthy low-fat diet. Results: While baseline microbiota composition was not predictive of weight loss, each diet resulted in substantial changes in the microbiota 3-mo after the start of the intervention; some of these changes were diet specific (14 taxonomic changes specific to the healthy low-carbohydrate diet, 12 taxonomic changes specific to the healthy low-fat diet) and others tracked with weight loss (7 taxonomic changes in both diets). After these initial shifts, the microbiota returned near its original baseline state for the remainder of the intervention, despite participants maintaining their diet and weight loss for the entire study. Conclusions: These results suggest a resilience to perturbation of the microbiota's starting profile. When considering the established contribution of obesity-associated microbiotas to weight gain in animal models, microbiota resilience may need to be overcome for long-term alterations to human physiology.

We show that microbial species maintain stable population sizes within and across humans and that commonly used ‘omics' survey methods are more reliable when using averages over multiple days of sampling. Variation of gut metabolites within people over time is associated with amino acid levels, and differences across people are associated with differences in bile acids. Finally, we show that genomic diversification can be used to infer eco-evolutionary dynamics and in vivo selection pressures for strains within individuals.

abstract = {We investigate the effect of education Conditional Cash Transfer programs (CCTs) on teenage pregnancy. Our main concern is with how the size and sign of the effect may depend on the design of the program. Using a simple model we show that an education CCT that conditions renewal on school performance reduces teenage pregnancy; the program can increase teenage pregnancy if it does not condition on school performance. Then, using an original data base, we estimate the causal impact on teenage pregnancy of two education CCTs implemented in Bogot{\'{a}} (Subsidio Educativo, SE, and Familias en Acci{\'{o}}n, FA); both programs differ particularly on whether school success is a condition for renewal or not. We show that SE has negative average effect on teenage pregnancy while FA has a null average effect. We also find that SE has either null or no effect for adolescents in all age and grade groups while FA has positive, null or negative effects for adolescents in different age and grade groups. Since SE conditions renewal on school success and FA does not, we can argue that the empirical results are consistent with the predictions of our model and that conditioning renewal of the subsidy on school success crucially determines the effect of the subsidy on teenage pregnancy.},

abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most frequent cause of liver disease in the Western world. Furthermore, it is increasing worldwide, paralleling the obesity pandemic. Though highly frequent, only about one fifth of affected subjects are at risk of developing the progressive form of the disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with fibrosis. Even in the latter, liver disease is slowly progressive, though, since it is so prevalent, it is already the third cause of liver transplantation in the United States, and it is predicted to get to the top of the ranking in few years. Of relevance, fatty liver is also associated with increased overall mortality and particularly increased cardiovascular mortality. The literature and amount of published papers on NAFLD is increasing as fast as its prevalence, which makes it difficult to keep updated in this topic. This review aims to summarize the latest knowledge on NAFLD, in order to help clinicians understanding its pathogenesis and advances on diagnosis and treatment.},

abstract = {Background & Aims: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent, yet largely underappreciated liver condition which is closely associated with obesity and metabolic disease. Despite affecting an estimated 1 in 4 adults globally, NAFLD is largely absent on national and global health agendas. Methods: We collected data from 102 countries, accounting for 86% of the world population, on NAFLD policies, guidelines, civil society engagement, clinical management, and epidemiologic data. A preparedness index was developed by coding questions into 6 domains (policies, guidelines, civil awareness, epidemiology and data, NAFLD detection, and NAFLD care management) and categorising the responses as high, medium, and low; a multiple correspondence analysis was then applied. Results: The highest scoring countries were India (42.7) and the United Kingdom (40.0), with 32 countries (31%) scoring zero out of 100. For 5 of the domains a minority of countries were categorised as high-level while the majority were categorised as low-level. No country had a national or sub-national strategy for NAFLD and <2% of the different strategies for related conditions included any mention of NAFLD. National NAFLD clinical guidelines were present in only 32 countries. Conclusions: Although NAFLD is a pressing public health problem, no country was found to be well prepared to address it. There is a pressing need for strategies to address NAFLD at national and global levels. Lay summary: Around a third of the countries scored a zero on the NAFLD policy preparedness index, with no country scoring over 50/100. Although NAFLD is a pressing public health problem, a comprehensive public health response is lacking in all 102 countries. Policies and strategies to address NAFLD at the national and global levels are urgently needed.},

abstract = {Background and Aims: Vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), point shear wave elastography (pSWE), 2-dimensional shear wave elastography (2DSWE), magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been proposed as non-invasive tests for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study evaluated their diagnostic accuracy for liver fibrosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Methods: PubMED/MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies examining the diagnostic accuracy of these index tests, against histology as the reference standard, in adult patients with NAFLD. Two authors independently screened and assessed methodological quality of studies and extracted data. Summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (sAUC) were calculated for fibrosis stages and NASH, using a random effects bivariate logit-normal model. Results: We included 82 studies (14,609 patients). Meta-analysis for diagnosing fibrosis stages was possible in 53 VCTE, 11 MRE, 12 pSWE and 4 2DSWE studies, and for diagnosing NASH in 4 MRE studies. sAUC for diagnosis of significant fibrosis were: 0.83 for VCTE, 0.91 for MRE, 0.86 for pSWE and 0.75 for 2DSWE. sAUC for diagnosis of advanced fibrosis were: 0.85 for VCTE, 0.92 for MRE, 0.89 for pSWE and 0.72 for 2DSWE. sAUC for diagnosis of cirrhosis were: 0.89 for VCTE, 0.90 for MRE, 0.90 for pSWE and 0.88 for 2DSWE. MRE had sAUC of 0.83 for diagnosis of NASH. Three (4%) studies reported intention-to-diagnose analyses and 15 (18%) studies reported diagnostic accuracy against pre-specified cut-offs. Conclusions: When elastography index tests are acquired successfully, they have acceptable diagnostic accuracy for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. The potential clinical impact of these index tests cannot be assessed fully as intention-to-diagnose analyses and validation of pre-specified thresholds are lacking. Lay summary: Non-invasive tests that measure liver stiffness or use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been suggested as alternatives to liver biopsy for assessing the severity of liver scarring (fibrosis) and fatty inflammation (steatohepatitis) in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we summarise the results of previously published studies on how accurately these non-invasive tests can diagnose liver fibrosis and inflammation, using liver biopsy as the reference.

abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global public health problem. However, the natural history of NAFLD is incomplete. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients identified with NAFLD by diagnosis codes in a large, community-based health care delivery system. The objectives were (1) to follow patients from initial NAFLD presentation through progression to cirrhosis and/or decompensated cirrhosis to liver cancer, liver transplant, and death for up to 10 years; and (2) to conduct disease progression analysis restricted to patients with NAFLD identified as having diabetes at baseline. A total of 98,164 patients with full NAFLD and 26,488 with diabetes were divided into three baseline prevalent states: (1) no cirrhosis, (2) compensated cirrhosis, and (3) decompensated cirrhosis. In baseline patients without cirrhosis, annual rates of compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, and death were 0.28%, 0.31%, and 0.63% per year, respectively. With baseline compensated cirrhosis, the annual rates of decompensation and death were 2.4% and 6.7% per year. Finally, in those with decompensated cirrhosis at baseline, the death rate was 8.0% per year. In those without cirrhosis and with cirrhosis at baseline, the rates of liver cancer and death were increased approximately 2-fold in the diabetic subpopulation compared with the full NAFLD cohort. Age and comorbidities increased with increasing disease severity. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that cirrhosis was strongly associated with death and liver cancer, and that diabetes was associated with a significant increase in the hazard of both liver cancer and death (2.56 [2.04-3.20] and 1.43 [1.35-1.52]), respectively. Conclusion: The findings of this community-based study further our understanding of the natural history of NAFLD and demonstrate that diabetes is a major factor in the progression of this disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND. An increase in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) is the hallmark feature of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is decreased by weight loss. Hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) contributes to steatosis in individuals with NAFLD. The physiological factors that stimulate hepatic DNL and the effect of weight loss on hepatic DNL are not clear. METHODS. Hepatic DNL, 24-hour integrated plasma insulin and glucose concentrations, and both liver and whole-body insulin sensitivity were determined in individuals who were lean (n = 14), obese with normal IHTG content (n = 26), or obese with NAFLD (n = 27). Hepatic DNL was assessed using the deuterated water method corrected for the potential confounding contribution of adipose tissue DNL. Liver and whole-body insulin sensitivity was assessed using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in conjunction with glucose tracer infusion. Six subjects in the obese-NAFLD group were also evaluated before and after a diet-induced weight loss of 10%. RESULTS. The contribution of hepatic DNL to IHTG-palmitate was 11%, 19%, and 38% in the lean, obese, and obese-NAFLD groups, respectively. Hepatic DNL was inversely correlated with hepatic and whole-body insulin sensitivity, but directly correlated with 24-hour plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Weight loss decreased IHTG content, in conjunction with a decrease in hepatic DNL and 24-hour plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest hepatic DNL is an important regulator of IHTG content and that increases in circulating glucose and insulin stimulate hepatic DNL in individuals with NAFLD. Weight loss decreased IHTG content, at least in part, by decreasing hepatic DNL.},

abstract = {Approaches to manage nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are limited by an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to identify hepatic gene-expression patterns associated with different patterns of liver injury in a high-risk cohort of adults with obesity. Using the NanoString Technologies (Seattle, WA) nCounter assay, we quantified expression of 795 genes, hypothesized to be involved in hepatic fibrosis, inflammation, and steatosis, in liver tissue from 318 adults with obesity. Liver specimens were categorized into four distinct NAFLD phenotypes: normal liver histology (NLH), steatosis only (steatosis), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis without fibrosis (NASH F0), and NASH with fibrosis stage 1-4 (NASH F1-F4). One hundred twenty-five genes were significantly increasing or decreasing as NAFLD pathology progressed. Compared with NLH, NASH F0 was characterized by increased inflammatory gene expression, such as gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (IFI30) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9), while complement and coagulation related genes, such as C9 and complement component 4 binding protein beta (C4BPB), were reduced. In the presence of NASH F1-F4, extracellular matrix degrading proteinases and profibrotic/scar deposition genes, such as collagens and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), were simultaneously increased, suggesting a dynamic state of tissue remodeling. Conclusion: In adults with obesity, distinct states of NAFLD are associated with intrahepatic perturbations in genes related to inflammation, complement and coagulation pathways, and tissue remodeling. These data provide insights into the dynamic pathogenesis of NAFLD in high-risk individuals.},

abstract = {Associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular events and cancer, obesity is a worldwide problem affecting developed and developing countries. Microcirculatory vessels, represented by arterioles, capillaries and venules (mean internal diameter < 100 $\mu$m), are the place where blood/tissue nutrition and exchange effectively take place. Microvascular dysfunction is an early event in obesity probably secondary to endothelial dysfunction and capillaries rarefaction. New research techniques allow the investigation of the microcirculation in different vascular beds in humans. Studies suggest a link between endothelial dysfunction and visceral obesity. Oxidative stress, inflammation and rennin-angiotensin system are among factors considered to be involved on microvascular dysfunction in obesity. Microcirculatory impairment present in obesity suggests that it could be an important causal factor in obesity-related disorders such as insulin resistance and hypertension.},

abstract = {Introduction: Obesity is characterized by excessive deposition of fat in adipose tissue and is associated with the development of pathological damage in several metabolic processes that are associated with oxidative stress and inflammation. Objective: To evaluate the levels of adiponectin, inflammatory markers and oxidative markers, with the objective of determining a biomarkers profile in adults that influences the metabolic risk of developing the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods: The groups studied included 84 adults (48 Without MetS and 36 With MetS). General and biochemical parameters were determined. Adiponectin levels, inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein (CRP)], interleukin 6 (IL-6), adenosine deaminase (ADA), dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) and oxidative markers [thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), sulfhydryl groups (SH), total ferric antioxidant power (FRAP) and Vitamin C] were also measured. Results: The MetS group presented a significant increase in insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) and uric acid, as well as gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and Vitamin C. Conclusion: The combination of IL-6, ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein (us-CRP), ADA, DPP-IV and the increase of TBARS, with the reduction of Vitamin C, SH groups and adiponectin, promote inflammation and compromise insulin sensitivity, thus presenting an active role in the pathogenesis of MetS. These findings are significant because they may assist in monitoring clinical changes, in the prevention of future cardiometabolic events in individuals with MetS, and in the identification of inflammatory and oxidative markers that assist in the monitoring and prevention of MetS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Although the rising pandemic of obesity has received major attention in many countries, the effects of this attention on trends and the disease burden of obesity remain uncertain. METHODS We analyzed data from 68.5 million persons to assess the trends in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adults between 1980 and 2015. Using the Global Burden of Disease study data and methods, we also quantified the burden of disease related to high body-mass index (BMI), according to age, sex, cause, and BMI in 195 countries between 1990 and 2015. RESULTS In 2015, a total of 107.7 million children and 603.7 million adults were obese. Since 1980, the prevalence of obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries and has continuously increased in most other countries. Although the prevalence of obesity among children has been lower than that among adults, the rate of increase in childhood obesity in many countries has been greater than the rate of increase in adult obesity. High BMI accounted for 4.0 million deaths globally, nearly 40% of which occurred in persons who were not obese. More than two thirds of deaths related to high BMI were due to cardiovascular disease. The disease burden related to high BMI has increased since 1990; however, the rate of this increase has been attenuated owing to decreases in underlying rates of death from cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS The rapid increase in the prevalence and disease burden of elevated BMI highlights the need for continued focus on surveillance of BMI and identification, implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based interventions to address this problem.

abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a significant health burden with an ever-increasing prevalence. They remain the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The use of medicinal herbs continues to be an alternative treatment approach for several diseases including CVDs. Currently, there is an unprecedented drive for the use of herbal preparations in modern medicinal systems. This drive is powered by several aspects, prime among which are their cost-effective therapeutic promise compared to standard modern therapies and the general belief that they are safe. Nonetheless, the claimed safety of herbal preparations yet remains to be properly tested. Consequently, public awareness should be raised regarding medicinal herbs safety, toxicity, potentially life-threatening adverse effects, and possible herb–drug interactions. Over the years, laboratory data have shown that medicinal herbs may have therapeutic value in CVDs as they can interfere with several CVD risk factors. Accordingly, there have been many attempts to move studies on medicinal herbs from the bench to the bedside, in order to effectively employ herbs in CVD treatments. In this review, we introduce CVDs and their risk factors. Then we overview the use of herbs for disease treatment in general and CVDs in particular. Further, data on the ethnopharmacological therapeutic potentials and medicinal properties against CVDs of four widely used plants, namely Ginseng, Ginkgo biloba, Ganoderma lucidum, and Gynostemma pentaphyllum, are gathered and reviewed. In particular, the employment of these four plants in the context of CVDs, such as myocardial infarction, hypertension, peripheral vascular diseases, coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and dyslipidemias has been reviewed, analyzed, and critically discussed. We also endeavor to document the recent studies aimed to dissect the cellular and molecular cardio-protective mechanisms of the four plants, using recently reported in vitro and in vivo studies. Finally, we reviewed and reported the results of the recent clinical trials that have been conducted using these four medicinal herbs with special emphasis on their efficacy, safety, and toxicity.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance is a condition in which insulin sensitivity is reduced and the insulin signaling pathway is impaired. Although often expressed as an increase in insulin concentration, the disease is characterized by a decrease in insulin action. This increased workload of the pancreas and the consequent decompensation are not only the main mechanisms for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but also exacerbate the damage of metabolic diseases, including obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, metabolic syndrome, and others. Many clinical trials have suggested the potential role of herbs in the treatment of insulin resistance, although most of the clinical trials included in this review have certain flaws and bias risks in their methodological design, including the generation of randomization, the concealment of allocation, blinding, and inadequate reporting of sample size estimates. These studies involve not only the single-flavored herbs, but also herbal formulas, extracts, and active ingredients. Numerous of in vitro and in vivo studies have pointed out that the role of herbal medicine in improving insulin resistance is related to interventions in various aspects of the insulin signaling pathway. The targets involved in these studies include insulin receptor substrate, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, glucose transporter, AMP-activated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3, mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Improved insulin sensitivity upon treatment with herbal medicine provides considerable prospects for treating insulin resistance. This article reviews studies of the target mechanisms of herbal treatments for insulin resistance.},

abstract = {Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disease with high prevalence in the developed countries. NAFLD has been considered as one of the leading causes of cryptogenic cirrhosis and chronic liver disease. The individuals with obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, and hypertension cardiovascular disease have a high risk to develop NAFLD. The related critical pathological events are associated with the development of NAFLD including insulin resistance, lipid metabolism dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis. The development of NAFLD range from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Hepatic steatosis is characterized by fat accumulation, which represents the early stage of NAFLD. Then, inflammation triggered by steatosis drives early NAFLD progression into NASH. Therefore, the amelioration of steatosis and inflammation is essential for NAFLD therapy. The herbal medicine have taken great effects on the improvement of steatosis and inflammation for treating NAFLD. It has been found out that these effects involved the multiple mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism and inflammation. In this review, we pay particular attention on herbal medicine treatment and make summary about the research of herbal medicine, including herb formula, herb extract and naturals compound on NAFLD. We make details about their protective effects, the mechanism of action involved in the amelioration steatosis and inflammation for NAFLD therapy as well as the clinical application.},

abstract = {Obesity has become a major global public health problem and is associated with a range of comorbidities including sleep disturbance and chronic pain. 1 There have been numerous studies on the associations between obesity, sleep, and pain, and on how and in which direction they influence each other. 1,2 Sleep debt, chronic pain, weight gain, and significant hormonal changes have all been suggested as possible outcomes of these relationships. 3-5 Results from a meta-analysis have shown that twins who are overweight are twice as likely to have low back pain compared to those of normal weight or below weight. 6 An example of this complex interaction can be found in some individuals with chronic pain, who may be restricted in their movement and become less active, thereby contributing to weight gain which, in turn, has been shown to be associated with sleep restriction. The literature shows that obesity can contribute to chronic pain through two main mechanisms: mechanical stress, with excess body weight causing stress on joints in the musculo-skeletal system; and systemic proinflammatory status, which is associated with obesity and can worsen pain. 7 Conversely, chronic pain can contribute to obesity through limiting physical activity because of fear of movement. 7 Other studies have shown body mass index (BMI) to be associated with pain, disability , depression, anxiety, reduced physical function, 8 and lack of sleep. 9 Several studies have demonstrated that sleep deprivation is associated with obesity in adults 3,10 through modifying appetite-regulating hormones and increasing caloric intake. The mechanism can be explained by sleep deprivation causing an imbalance between leptin and ghrelin. Leptin and ghrelin are peripheral signals that interact with the hypotha-lamic arcuate nucleus and modulate orexin system activity to decrease or increase food intake. 10 When there is sleep restriction , ghrelin increases whereas leptin decreases, therefore contributing to increased food intake. Previous studies have demonstrated that short sleep was also associated with unbalanced leptin and ghrelin and that these hormonal changes can result in increased BMI, which in turn can have negative effects on sleep. 3 Therefore, we would like to highlight the mechanisms involved in obesity and the important relationship between obesity , sleep, and chronic pain. Modern lifestyles have tended to produce more sedentary populations who consume more food LETTERS TO THE EDITOR and sleep less, 11 which has contributed to an increase in chronic diseases and less healthy populations. Thus, it is essential to implement awareness and prevention strategies that consider the relationships between all these factors in order to combat the risks to health. Changing behaviors is not easy, but it needs to be done given their current effect on health. CI TAT I O N Morelh{\~{a}}o PK, Tufik S, Andersen ML.

abstract = {Introduction: Pain remains largely undertreated in older adults irrespective of health care setting. Mexican American adults in the United States have a high age-adjusted prevalence of obesity. However, the association of pain and obesity with physical function is understudied in this population. Objective: To examine the association of co-occurring pain and obesity with physical function over 20 years of follow-up in a cohort of older Mexican Americans who scored ≥7 (moderate to high) in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test and were nondisabled at baseline. Design: Longitudinal population-based study. Setting: Community-dwelling older adults from Southwestern United States. Participants: Mexican American adults age 65 years and older. Interventions: Not Applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Physical function was assessed with the SPPB test (standing balance, timed 8-ft walk, and five repeated timed chair stands). Participants at baseline were divided into four groups: no pain–no obesity (n = 869), obesity only (n = 282), pain only (n = 216), and pain-obesity (n = 159). Generalized Estimating Equation models were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of lower performance in physical function over 20 years as a function of pain-obesity grouping. Results: Participants with pain only (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.34–1.95) and with co-occurring pain and obesity (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.83–2.95) had significantly greater odds of physical function impairment over those with no pain–no obesity or obesity only, after controlling for all covariates. Conclusion: Older Mexican American adults were at high risk for physical function impairment over time if they had pain or co-occurring pain and obesity. Early assessment and proper pain management as well as maintaining a healthy weight may reduce declines in physical function in older Mexican American adults.},

abstract = {Obesity and chronic pain frequently co-occur, and this co-occurrence can have potential negative consequences, particularly as it relates to mental health. As such, there is a need to understand potential risk factors for poor mental health among this co-morbid population. Thus, the current study examined the predictive role of anxiety sensitivity (and its sub-facets) on anxiety and depressive symptoms among adults (82.5% female, Mage = 40.2 years, SD = 10.92) with obesity and chronic pain. Results revealed that greater levels of anxiety sensitivity were associated with greater levels of both anxiety and depressive symptoms, with medium to large effect sizes. Post hoc analyses also indicated that specific sub-facets of anxiety sensitivity (cognitive and social concerns) were significant predictors of the criterion variables. The current study highlights the potential clinical utility in targeting anxiety sensitivity among individuals with co-occurring obesity and chronic pain in the treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms.},

Considerando as lacunas ainda existentes na fisiopatologia de delirium e seu potencial impacto cl{\'{i}}nico, justifica-se explorar as altera{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de microbioma intestinal nesta condi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. OBJETIVOS: O objetivo prim{\'{a}}rio deste estudo foi investigar a associa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre a composi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do microbioma intestinal e a ocorr{\^{e}}ncia de delirium em idosos agudamente enfermos hospitalizados. M{\'{E}}TODOS: Estudo prospectivo de coorte incluindo idosos agudamente enfermos com idade >= 65 anos, admitidos consecutivamente no pronto-socorro de um hospital universit{\'{a}}rio terci{\'{a}}rio, em S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brasil. Foram exclu{\'{i}}dos indiv{\'{i}}duos com doen{\c{c}}as gastrointestinais agudas, presen{\c{c}}a de alimenta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o artificial, uso recente de pr{\'{e}} ou probi{\'{o}}ticos, em uso de antibi{\'{o}}ticos por 24 horas ou mais na admiss{\~{a}}o, interna{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o recente ( < 30 dias), traumatismo cranionencef{\'{a}}lico grave ou admiss{\~{a}}o para cuidados de fim de vida. Os participantes foram avaliados nas primeiras 24 horas da admiss{\~{a}}o, seguindo protocolo padronizado com registro de dados sociodemogr{\'{a}}ficos, cl{\'{i}}nicos e laboratoriais. O desfecho prim{\'{a}}rio do estudo foi a ocorr{\^{e}}ncia de delirium conforme o Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Foram coletadas amostras de swab retal para an{\'{a}}lise do microbioma intestinal na inclus{\~{a}}o (S1), ap{\'{o}}s 72 horas da inclus{\~{a}}o (S2), e em caso de surgimento de delirium ou resolu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do mesmo ap{\'{o}}s admiss{\~{a}}o (S3). Os grupos de desfecho foram comparados quanto aos {\'{i}}ndices de diversidade alfa e beta, abund{\^{a}}ncia relativa de t{\'{a}}xons e core microbiome, tanto na amostra geral de swabs (observa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es dependentes), quanto conforme swabs no estrato dos participantes (amostras do baseline). As m{\'{e}}tricas de diversidade alfa foram comparadas entre os grupos com equa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de estimativas generalizadas (GEE) ou teste n{\~{a}}o-param{\'{e}}tricos tradicionais, e a diversidade beta foi avaliada usando permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Modelos de regress{\~{a}}o log{\'{i}}stica e de GEE foram utilizados para investigar a associa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre caracter{\'{i}}sticas do microbioma intestinal e delirium, ajustando as an{\'{a}}lises para idade, g{\^{e}}nero, {\'{i}}ndice de comorbidades de Charlson e {\'{i}}ndice de massa corp{\'{o}}rea. RESULTADOS: Foram inclu{\'{i}}dos 133 participantes entre 30 de setembro de 2019 e 17 de mar{\c{c}}o de 2020. Na amostra total, 56% eram do sexo masculino, com idade m{\'{e}}dia de 75 (±8) anos, e tempo de interna{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o mediano de 8 (5,15) dias. Delirium foi detectado em 38 participantes (29%), 19 deles na admiss{\~{a}}o e xvii outros 19 ao longo da interna{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o hospitalar. Obtivemos 262 amostras de swab retal (S1=133; S2=108; e S3=21). As amostras de participantes com delirium apresentaram menor abund{\^{a}}ncia e menor riqueza de microrganismos conforme indicado pelas m{\'{e}}tricas de diversidade alfa. Mesmo ap{\'{o}}s ajuste para poss{\'{i}}veis fatores de confus{\~{a}}o, maiores {\'{i}}ndices de diversidade alfa associaram-se a uma menor ocorr{\^{e}}ncia de delirium, tanto para o {\'{i}}ndice de Shannon (OR=0,77; IC 95%=0,60-0,99; P=0,042) quanto para o Pielou (OR=0,02; IC 95%=0,002-0,33; P=0,005). Houve diferen{\c{c}}a significativa em todas as m{\'{e}}tricas de diversidade beta de acordo com a presen{\c{c}}a de delirium, indicando uma composi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o microbiana divergente entre os grupos estudados. As an{\'{a}}lises de abund{\^{a}}ncia relativa e core microbiome indicaram alguns t{\'{a}}xons bacterianos mais associados ao grupo delirium (Serratia, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Methanobrevibacter), e outros, ao grupo sem delirium (Finegoldia e Anaerococcus). CONCLUS{\~{O}}ES: Observamos diferen{\c{c}}as significativas na diversidade e composi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do microbioma intestinal de acordo com a presen{\c{c}}a ou aus{\^{e}}ncia de delirium em idosos agudamente enfermos hospitalizados.

abstract = {O diabetes mellitus tipo 2 est{\'{a}} intimamente ligado a forma{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de esp{\'{e}}cies reativas de oxig{\^{e}}nio, as quais aumentam os produtos de glica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o avan{\c{c}}ada e consequentemente a inflama{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e o desenvolvimento das complica{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es associadas a doen{\c{c}}a. Nesse contexto, destaca-se o papel do microbioma intestinal, visto que esta pode ser capaz de modificar fatores ligados ao sistema imune e sua modula{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o pode ser uma boa alternativa para melhora do quadro inflamat{\'{o}}rio e complica{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es da doen{\c{c}}a. A castanha-do-brasil, fonte de sel{\^{e}}nio, al{\'{e}}m de outros nutrientes, poderia atuar no sistema de defesa antioxidante e anti-inflamat{\'{o}}rio, al{\'{e}}m de influenciar a microbiota intestinal, resultando benef{\'{i}}cios aos pacientes. Portanto, este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar estes efeitos da suplementa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de indiv{\'{i}}duos com diabetes mellitus tipo 2, com uma n{\'{o}}z de castanha-do-brasil (Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K.) por dia, durante 60 dias. Para tanto, foi delineado um ensaio cl{\'{i}}nico, longitudinal, com 29 pacientes volunt{\'{a}}rios com diabetes mellitus tipo 2, atendidos no Ambulat{\'{o}}rio de Endocrinologia do Hospital das Cl{\'{i}}nicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S{\~{a}}o Paulo. Os participantes foram avaliados antes e ap{\'{o}}s a interven{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, e realizaram uma coleta de fezes (caracteriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da microbiota intestinal e concentra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de sel{\^{e}}nio) e uma coleta de sangue (an{\'{a}}lises de status de sel{\^{e}}nio, marcadores inflamat{\'{o}}rios, glic{\^{e}}micos e lip{\'{i}}dicos, e da permeabilidade intestinal), a avalia{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da ingest{\~{a}}o alimentar foi por meio de Registro Alimentar de 3 dias Inicialmente, determinou-se a composi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o centesimal e a concentra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de sel{\^{e}}nio da castanha-do-brasil utilizada. A an{\'{a}}lise bioinform{\'{a}}tica foi conduzida usando o Quantitative Insight into Microbial Ecology (QIIME, vers{\~{a}}o 1.9.0). A an{\'{a}}lise estat{\'{i}}stica foi realizada com os softwares Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, vers{\~{a}}o 23.0, e R vers{\~{a}}o 1.1.463. A concentra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de sel{\^{e}}nio na castanha in natura foi de 79,8µg/g. A idade m{\'{e}}dia dos participantes foi 54,9±3,6 anos. A ingest{\~{a}}o de castanha-do-brasil foi capaz de melhorar significativamente os par{\^{a}}metros: concentra{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de sel{\^{e}}nio no plasma (&#916; 95,82, p<0,001), nos eritr{\'{o}}citos (&#916; 163,16, p<0,001) e nas fezes (&#916; 166,31 p<0,001), assim como na selenoprote{\'{i}}na P (&#916; 5,36 p<0,026) e atividade da enzima glutationa peroxidase (&#916; 30,61 p<0,040) e redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da hemoglobina glicada (&#916; -0,8, p=0,001). No entanto, n{\~{a}}o houve altera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do perfil lip{\'{i}}dico, inflamat{\'{o}}rio, ingest{\~{a}}o alimentar e marcadores antropom{\'{e}}tricos. Apesar de n{\~{a}}o verificarmos mudan{\c{c}}a na composi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o global da microbiota intestinal, a diversidade interpessoal ({\ss} diversidade) variou conforme a concentra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de selenoprote{\'{i}}na P (p=0,03) e porcentagem de hemoglobina glicada (p=0,04). A suplementa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com castanha-do-brasil melhorou o perfil glic{\^{e}}mico e o status de sel{\^{e}}nio. Apesar de n{\~{a}}o ser observada influ{\^{e}}ncia na composi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o global da microbiota, a segrega{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o observada indica certa resist{\^{e}}ncia da microbiota frente a interven{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com a castanha},

abstract = {The dynamic and delicate interactions amongst intestinal microbiota, metabolome and metabolism dictates human health and disease. In recent years, our understanding of gut microbial regulation of intestinal immunometabolic and redox homeostasis have evolved mainly out of in vivo studies associated with high-fat feeding induced metabolic diseases. Techniques utilizing fecal transplantation and germ-free mice have been instrumental in reproducibly demonstrating how the gut microbiota affects disease pathogenesis. However, the pillars of modern drug discovery i.e. evidence-based pharmacological studies critically lack focus on intestinal microflora. This is primarily due to targeted in vitro molecular-approaches at cellular-level that largely overlook the etiology of disease pathogenesis from the physiological perspective. Thus, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the key notions of intestinal microbiota and dysbiosis, and highlight the microbiota-phytochemical bidirectional interactions that affects bioavailability and bioactivity of parent phytochemicals and their metabolites. Potentially by focusing on the three major aspects of gut microbiota i.e. microbial abundance, diversity, and functions, I will discuss phytochemical-microbiota reciprocal interactions, biotransformation of phytochemicals and plant-derived drugs, and pre-clinical and clinical efficacies of herbal medicine on dysbiosis. Additionally, in relation to phytochemical pharmacology, I will briefly discuss the role of dietary-patterns associated with changes in microbial profiles and review pharmacological study models considering possible microbial effects. This review therefore, emphasize on the timely and critically needed evidence-based phytochemical studies focusing on gut microbiota and will provide newer insights for future pre-clinical and clinical phytopharmacological interventions.},

Curcumin is a natural polyphenol extracted from turmeric, a spice widely used all over the world. Curcumin is clinically used due to its acceptable safety profile and therapeutic efficacy. Aim of the study Current paper aims to highlight the effect of curcumin on concomitantly used drugs. Methods Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct were searched with the keywords “curcumin” in the title/abstract and “drug interaction,” “drug metabolism,” “cytochrome,” P-glycoprotein and “P450” in the whole text. Results Curcumin can induce pharmacokinetic alterations such as changes in Cmax and AUC when concomitantly used with pharmacological agents like cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, anticoagulants, antibiotics, chemotherapeutic agents, and antihistamines. The underlying mechanisms of these interactions include inhibition of cytochrome (CYP) isoenzymes and P-glycoprotein. There is only one clinical trial which proved a significant alteration of conventional drugs in concomitant use with curcumin indicating the need for further human studies. Conclusions Although in vitro and in vivo studies do not provide enough evidence to judge the clinical drug interactions of curcumin, physicians must remain cautious and avoid drug combinations which may lead to curcumin-drug interactions.},

abstract = {Curcumin is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound present in rhizome of Curcuma longa belonging to the family zingiberaceae. Growing experimental evidence revealed that curcumin exhibit multitarget biological implications signifying its crucial role in health and disease. The current review highlights the recent progress and mechanisms underlying the wide range of pharmacological effects of curcumin against numerous diseases like neuronal, cardiovascular, metabolic, kidney, endocrine, skin, respiratory, infectious, gastrointestinal diseases and cancer. The ability of curcumin to modulate the functions of multiple signal transductions are linked with attenuation of acute and chronic diseases. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have revealed that curcumin modulates several molecules in cell signal transduction pathway including PI3K, Akt, mTOR, ERK5, AP-1, TGF-$\beta$, Wnt, $\beta$-catenin, Shh, PAK1, Rac1, STAT3, PPAR$\gamma$, EBP$\alpha$, NLRP3 inflammasome, p38MAPK, Nrf2, Notch-1, AMPK, TLR-4 and MyD-88. Curcumin has a potential to prevent and/or manage various diseases due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic properties with an excellent safety profile. In contrast, the anti-cancer effects of curcumin are reflected due to induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in various premalignant and malignant cells. This review also carefully emphasized the pharmacokinetics of curcumin and its interaction with other drugs. Clinical studies have shown that curcumin is safe at the doses of 12 g/day but exhibits poor systemic bioavailability. The use of adjuvant like piperine, liposomal curcumin, curcumin nanoparticles and curcumin phospholipid complex has shown enhanced bioavailability and therapeutic potential. Further studies are warranted to prove the potential of curcumin against various ailments.},

abstract = {About 70% of the world population is currently using medicinal herbs as complementary or alternative medicine, which is increasing at a tremendous pace in both developed and developing countries in the last two decades (World Health Organization Medicines Strategy 2002–2005). This increase in consumer demand of medicinal herbs continues despite the rarity of scientific data to establish their safety and efficacy profile. Its popularity is also attributed to several factors, including easy availability, cost effectiveness leading to better purchasing power and general perception that they are safe. Herbs are often administered concomitantly with therapeutic drugs for the treatment of major ailments, raising the potential for herb–drug interactions (HDIs). The major pathways postulated for HDIs involves the cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated inhibition or induction and transport and efflux proteins. In our review, we highlight frequently used herbal medicines for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders (CVD), their established HDIs studied using in vitro tools and in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assays and case reports. Herbs have been divided into different sections on the basis of availability of HDI data in relevance to cardiovascular drugs: herbs reported to interact with cardiac drugs, herbs yet to be reported for interaction with drugs of any class and herbs reported to interact with drugs of other therapeutic category but not with cardiac drugs. The amount of active phytoconstituents present in the selected herbs and their extent of bioavailability are also mentioned. This review can serve as a quick reference database for physicians and health care professionals involved in CVD treatment, aimed at maximizing clinical outcomes with reduction in adverse and toxic effects.},

As curcuminoids are often taken as supplements by some population groups, it may be asked whether this can lead to changes in the pharmacokinetics or phar-macodynamics of other drugs taken at the same time. It is particularly important to clarify this issue, as native curcumin only exhibits low bioavailability, but many novel formulations are being developed that enhance its absorption in the small intestine and thus lead to higher concentrations of the active drug. Cell culture and animal studies have shown that native curcumin can affect xenobiotic meta-bolizing enzymes. There are also effects on the pharmacokinetics of active substances in animal studies and in men. On the other hand, it has not been shown that curcumin has any adverse effects on the pharmacological activity of other drugs. However, it must be emphasized that these studies are preliminary rather than conclusive and must be supported by larger scale investigations.

abstract = {Introduction. Curcumin is a polyphenolic compound derived from the plant Curcuma Long Lin that has been demonstrated to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well as effects on reducing beta-amyloid aggregation. It reduces pathology in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a promising candidate for treating human AD. The purpose of the current study is to generate tolerability and preliminary clinical and biomarker efficacy data on curcumin in persons with AD. Methods. We performed a 24-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of Curcumin C3 Complex {\textregistered} with an open-label extension to 48 weeks. Thirty-six persons with mild-to-moderate AD were randomized to receive placebo, 2 grams/day, or 4 grams/day of oral curcumin for 24 weeks. For weeks 24 through 48, subjects that were receiving curcumin continued with the same dose, while subjects previously receiving placebo were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 grams/day or 4 grams/day. The primary outcome measures were incidence of adverse events, changes in clinical laboratory tests and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) at 24 weeks in those completing the study. Secondary outcome measures included the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) scale, levels of A$\beta$1-40 and A$\beta$1-42in plasma and levels of A$\beta$1-42 t-tau, p-tau 181 and F2-isoprostanes in cerebrospinal fluid. Plasma levels of curcumin and its metabolites up to four hours after drug administration were also measured. Results: Mean age of completers (n = 30) was 73.5 years and mean Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score was 22.5. One subject withdrew in the placebo (8%, worsened memory) and 5/24 subjects withdrew in the curcumin group (21%, 3 due to gastrointestinal symptoms). Curcumin C3 Complex{\textregistered} was associated with lowered hematocrit and increased glucose levels that were clinically insignificant. There were no differences between treatment groups in clinical or biomarker efficacy measures. The levels of native curcumin measured in plasma were low (7.32 ng/mL). Conclusions: Curcumin was generally well-tolerated although three subjects on curcumin withdrew due to gastrointestinal symptoms. We were unable to demonstrate clinical or biochemical evidence of efficacy of Curcumin C3 Complex,sup>{\textregistered} in AD in this 24-week placebo-controlled trial although preliminary data suggest limited bioavailability of this compound.

Saffron rhizomes were randomly collected in natura with a hoe from the soil in Rio Verde, Goi{\'{a}}s, Brazil. They were subsequently sized, sanitized, and sliced into 2.63 ± 0.1 mm thick sections. Rhizomes were dried in an oven with forced air ventilation at 45, 55, 65 and 75 °C for 18, 14, 10 and 9 hours, respectively. As the temperature increased, drying time was reduced. Consequently, moisture content also decreased, facilitating the drying process by decreasing the energy required to remove water molecules. Among the analyzed models, the Midilli model was best adjusted to the data under different drying air conditions. Effective diffusion coefficients (D) were 9.17 × 10-11, 13.33 × 10-11, 20.09 × 10-11, and 35.89 × 10-11 m2 s-1 at 45, 55, 65 and 75 °C, respectively, increasing with higher temperatures.

abstract = {Curcumin is a natural product currently in human clinical trials for a variety of neoplas-tic, preneoplastic, and inflammatory conditions. We previously observed that, in cultured cells, curcumin exhibits properties of an iron chelator. To test whether the chelator activity of curcumin is sufficient to induce iron deficiency in vivo, mice were placed on diets containing graded concentrations of both iron and curcumin for 26 weeks. Mice receiving the lowest level of dietary iron exhibited borderline iron deficiency, with reductions in spleen and liver iron, but little effect on hemoglobin, hematocrit, trans-ferrin saturation, or plasma iron. Against this backdrop of subclinical iron deficiency, curcumin exerted profound 2 effects on systemic iron, inducing a dose-dependent decline in hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum iron, and transferrin saturation, the appearance of microcytic anisocytotic red blood cells, and decreases in spleen and liver iron content. Curcumin repressed synthesis of hepcidin, a peptide that plays a central role in regulation of systemic iron balance. These results demonstrate that curcumin has the potential to affect systemic iron metabolism , particularly in a setting of subclinical iron deficiency. This may affect the use of curcumin in patients with marginal iron stores or those exhibiting the anemia of cancer and chronic disease. (Blood. 2009; 113:462-469)},

abstract = {Objective Curcumin, a component of the curry powder turmeric, has immense biological properties, including anticancer effects. The objective of this study was to determine if curcumin can provide a novel non-steroidal contraceptive having both spermicidal and microbicidal properties. Study design The effect of curcumin, with and without photosensitization, was examined on human sperm forward motility and growth of several aerobic (n = 8) and anaerobic bacteria (n = 4) and yeast (n = 7) strains implicated in vaginosis, vaginitis, and vaginal infections in women. The effect of various concentrations of curcumin on human sperm and microbes (aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and yeast) was tested. The effect on sperm was examined by counting the sperm forward motility, and on microbes by agar and broth dilutions and colony counting. Each experiment was repeated using different semen specimens, and bacteria and yeast stocks. Results Curcumin caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of sperm forward motility with a total block at ≥250 $\mu$M concentration. After photosensitization, the effective concentration to completely block sperm forward motility decreased 25-fold, now requiring only 10 $\mu$M concentration for total inhibition. Curcumin concentrations between 100 and 500 $\mu$M completely blocked the growth of all the bacteria and yeast strains tested. After photosensitization, the effective concentration to completely inhibit microbial growth decreased 10-fold for aerobic bacteria and yeast, and 5-fold for anaerobic bacteria. Conclusions These findings suggest that curcumin can block sperm function and bacteria/yeast growth. It can potentially provide an ideal non-steroidal contraceptive having both spermicidal and microbicidal properties against vaginal infections. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Although turmeric (Curcuma longa; an Indian spice) has been described in Ayurveda, as a treatment for inflammatory diseases and is referred by different names in different cultures, the active principle called curcumin or diferuloylmethane, a yellow pigment present in turmeric (curry powder) has been shown to exhibit numerous activities. Extensive research over the last half century has revealed several important functions of curcumin. It binds to a variety of proteins and inhibits the activity of various kinases. By modulating the activation of various transcription factors, curcumin regulates the expression of inflammatory enzymes, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and cell survival proteins. Curcumin also downregulates cyclin D1, cyclin E and MDM2; and upregulates p21, p27, and p53. Various preclinical cell culture and animal studies suggest that curcumin has potential as an antiproliferative, anti-invasive, and antiangiogenic agent; as a mediator of chemoresistance and radioresistance; as a chemopreventive agent; and as a therapeutic agent in wound healing, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and arthritis. Pilot phase I clinical trials have shown curcumin to be safe even when consumed at a daily dose of 12 g for 3 months. Other clinical trials suggest a potential therapeutic role for curcumin in diseases such as familial adenomatous polyposis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, hypercholesteremia, atherosclerosis, pancreatitis, psoriasis, chronic anterior uveitis and arthritis. Thus, curcumin, a spice once relegated to the kitchen shelf, has moved into the clinic and may prove to be "Curecumin". {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {Curcumin, the main constituent of turmeric, is suspected to possess cancer chemopreventive properties. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters have been reported, but few data exist describing whether methodologies are suitably robust for curcuminoid detection in colonic biopsy specimens. Information on the acceptability of prolonged administration of daily curcumin is not available. This is of vital importance to implement chemoprevention strategies. This study aimed to quantify levels of curcuminoids in colorectal mucosa of patients undergoing colorectal endoscopy or surgical resection and to obtain information on the acceptability and compliance with daily curcumin. Curcumin C3 complex (2.35 g) was administered to patients once daily for 14 days before endoscopic biopsy or colonic resection. Safety and tolerance were monitored. Analysis of curcuminoids in plasma, urine, and colonic mucosa was conducted by ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-UV with characterization by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). Twenty-four of 26 patients commencing curcumin completed the course. Six patients reported mild gastrointestinal adverse events. Curcuminoids were detectable in nine of 24 plasma samples, 24 of 24 urine samples, and in the colonic mucosa of all 23 biopsied participants. Mean tissue levels were 48.4 $\mu$g/g (127.8 nmol/g) of parent curcuminoids. The major conjugate, curcumin glucuronide, was detectable in 29 of 35 biopsies. High levels of topical curcumin persisted in the mucosa for up to 40 hours postadministration. Sixteen participants (67%) stated that they would take curcumin long-term should it be of proven benefit. In summary, pharmacologically active levels of curcumin were recovered from colonic mucosa. The regimen used here seems safe, and patients support its use in long-term trials. {\textcopyright}2012 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {Curcumin, the major yellow pigment in turmeric, prevents the development of adenomas in the intestinal tract of the C57BI/6J Min/+ mouse, a model of human familial APC. To aid the rational development of curcumin as a colorectal cancer-preventive agent, we explored the link between its chemopreventive potency in the Min/+ mouse and levels of drug and metabolites in target tissue and plasma. Mice received dietary curcumin for 15 weeks, after which adenomas were enumerated. Levels of curcumin and metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in plasma, tissues, and feces of mice after either long-term ingestion of dietary curcumin or a single dose of [14C]curcumin (100 mg/kg) via the i.p. route. Whereas curcumin at 0.1% in the diet was without effect, at 0.2 and 0.5%, it reduced adenoma multiplicity by 39 and 40%, respectively, compared with untreated mice. Hematocrit values in untreated Min/+ mice were drastically reduced compared with those in wild-type C57BI/6J mice. Dietary curcumin partially restored the suppressed hematocrit. Traces of curcumin were detected in the plasma. Its concentration in the small intestinal mucosa, between 39 and 240 nmol/g of tissue, reflects differences in dietary concentration. [14C]Curcumin disappeared rapidly from tissues and plasma within 2-8 h after dosing. Curcumin may be useful in the chemoprevention of human intestinal malignancies related to Apc mutations. The comparison of dose, resulting curcumin levels in the intestinal tract, and chemopreventive potency suggests tentatively that a daily dose of 1.6 g of curcumin is required for efficacy in humans. A clear advantage of curcumin over nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is its ability to decrease intestinal bleeding linked to adenoma maturation.},

abstract = {Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a yellow substance from the root of the plant Curcuma longa Linn., has been demonstrated to inhibit carcinogenesis of murine skin, stomach, intestine and liver. However, the toxicology, pharmacokinetics and biologically effective dose of curcumin in humans have not been reported. This prospective phase-I study evaluated these issues of curcumin in patients with one of the following five high-risk conditions: 1) recently resected urinary bladder cancer; 2) arsenic Bowen's disease of the skin; 3) uterine cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN); 4) oral leucoplakia; and 5) intestinal metaplasia of the stomach. Curcumin was taken orally for 3 months. Biopsy of the lesion sites was done immediately before and 3 months after starting curcumin treament. The starting dose was 500 mg/day. If no toxicity > or = grade II was noted in at least 3 successive patients, the dose was then escalated to another level in the order of 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, 8,000, and 12,000 mg/day. The concentration of curcumin in serum and urine was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). A total of 25 patients were enrolled in this study. There was no treatment-related toxicity up to 8,000 mg/day. Beyond 8,000 mg/day, the bulky volume of the drug was unacceptable to the patients. The serum concentration of curcumin usually peaked at 1 to 2 hours after oral intake of crucumin and gradually declined within 12 hours. The average peak serum concentrations after taking 4,000 mg, 6,000 mg and 8,000 mg of curcumin were 0.51 +/- 0.11 microM, 0.63 +/- 0.06 microM and 1.77 +/- 1.87 microM, respectively. Urinary excretion of curcumin was undetectable. One of 4 patients with CIN and 1 of 7 patients with oral leucoplakia proceeded to develop frank malignancies in spite of curcumin treatment. In contrast, histologic improvement of precancerous lesions was seen in 1 out of 2 patients with recently resected bladder cancer, 2 out of 7 patients of oral leucoplakia, 1 out of 6 patients of intestinal metaplasia of the stomach, I out of 4 patients with CIN and 2 out of 6 patients with Bowen's disease. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that curcumin is not toxic to humans up to 8,000 mg/day when taken by mouth for 3 months. Our results also suggest a biologic effect of curcumin in the chemoprevention of cancer.},

abstract = {Background: Curcumin is the major yellow pigment extracted from turmeric, a commonly-used spice in India and Southeast Asia that has broad anticarcinogenic and cancer chemopreventive potential. However, few systematic studies of curcumin's pharmacology and toxicology in humans have been performed. Methods: A dose escalation study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose and safety of a single dose of standardized powder extract, uniformly milled curcumin (C3 Complex™ Sabinsa Corporation). Healthy volunteers were administered escalating doses from 500 to 12,000 Mg. Results: Seven of twenty-four subjects (30%) experienced only minimal toxicity that did not appear to be dose-related. No curcumin was detected in the serum of subjects administered 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, 6,000 or 8,000 mg. Low levels of curcumin were detected in two subjects administered 10,000 or 12,000 mg. Conclusion: The tolerance of curcumin in high single oral doses appears to be excellent. Given that achieving systemic bioavailability of curcumin or its metabolites may not be essential for colorectal cancer chemoprevention, these findings warrant further investigation for its utility as a long-term chemopreventive agent. {\textcopyright} 2006 Lao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The reproductive toxicity of curcumin, turmeric yellow, in Wistar rats was studied in order to generate additional relevant toxicity information for the use of curcumin in humans by oral administration. The two generation reproduction study was designed and conducted in accordance with OECD Guideline No. 416 [OECD, 1983. Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals, Guideline No. 416. Two Generation Reproduction Toxicity Study, adopted on 26th May 1983] and in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (OECD, 1997 Principles of Good Laboratory Practice for the Testing of Chemicals. OECD, C(97)186/Final). The curcumin, mixed in the experimental diet at the concentrations of 1500, 3000 and 10,000 ppm was fed to three groups of rats, i.e., low, mid and high dose groups, and studied for two successive generations. A concurrent control group received experimental diet without the curcumin mixture. There were no treatment related adverse toxicological effects in the parental animals. No gross or microscopic changes were observed in any of the organs. None of the reproductive parameters were affected and there were no effects on the offspring other than a small reduction in pre-weaning body weight gain of the F2 pups at the highest dose level. It was concluded that the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for reproductive toxicity of curcumin, fed in the diet for two successive generations to rats in this study was 10,000 ppm, which is equivalent to 847 and 959 mg/kg bodyweight (bw) per day for male rats and 1043 and 1076 for females for F0 and F1 generations, respectively. This study was the final toxicology study on curcumin reviewed by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) at the 61st Meeting, 2003. The JECFA group considered that the small body weight reduction in the F2 pups of the highest dose group prevented this from being regarded as a no adverse effect level, and so allocated an ADI for curcumin of 0-3 mg/kg bw based on the intake of 250-320 mg/kg bw in the mid-dose group as the NOEL. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Among the extensive public and scientific interest in the use of phytochemicals to prevent or treat human diseases in recent years, natural compounds have been highly investigated to elucidate their therapeutic effect on chronic human diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disease. Curcumin, an active principle of the perennial herb Curcuma longa, has attracted an increasing research interest over the last half-century due to its diversity of molecular targets, including transcription factors, enzymes, protein kinases, growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, receptors, and it's interesting pharmacological activities. Despite that, the clinical effectiveness of the native curcumin is weak, owing to its low bioavailability and rapid metabolism. Preclinical data obtained from animal models and phase I clinical studies done in human volunteers confirmed a small amount of intestinal absorption, hepatic first pass effect, and some degree of intestinal metabolism, might explain its poor systemic availability when it is given via the oral route. During the last decade, researchers have attempted with new pharmaceutical methods such as nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, solid dispersions, emulsions, and microspheres to improve the bioavailability of curcumin. As a result, a significant number of bioavailable curcumin-based formulations were introduced with a varying range of enhanced bioavailability. This manuscript critically reviews the available scientific evidence on the basic and clinical effects and molecular targets of curcumin. We also discuss its pharmacokinetic and problems for marketing curcumin as a drug.},

abstract = {Background and objective: The current systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was carried out to assess the influence of curcumin intake on weight among patients with metabolic syndrome and related disorders. Methods: We searched the following databases up until January 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The relevant data were extracted and evaluated for quality of the studies in accordance with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data were pooled using the inverse variance method and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: Eighteen articles (21 studies) that comprised a total of 1,604 individuals were finally included in the meta-analysis. Curcumin intake significantly reduced body mass index (BMI) (SMD −0.37; 95% CI, −0.61, −0.13; P < 0.01), weight (SMD −0.23; 95% CI, −0.39, −0.06; P < 0.01), waist-circumference (WC) (SMD −0.25; 95% CI, −0.44, −0.05; P = 0.01), leptin levels (SMD −0.97; 95% CI, −1.18, −0.75; P < 0.001) and increased adiponectin levels (SMD 1.05; 95% CI, 0.23, 1.87; P = 0.01). We found no significant effect of curcumin intake on hip ratio (HR) (SMD −0.17; 95% CI, −0.42, 0.08; P = 0.18). Conclusions: Overall, we have found that curcumin intake among patients with metabolic syndrome and related disorders was correlated with a significant reduction in BMI, weight, WC, and leptin, and a significant increase in adiponectin levels, but did not affect HR.},

Curcumin, the principal curcuminoids found in turmeric, has long been used in traditional Indian and Chinese medicines to treat a variety of ailments, including jaundice and hepatic disorders, rheumatism, anorexia, and diabetic wounds. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), an orange-yellow component of turmeric, is a polyphenol, therefore responsible for modulating multiple signaling pathways and exerting a wide spectrum of biological and pharmacological properties (including antiinflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, antibacterial, anticarcinogenic, neuroprotective, chemoprotective, vasodilatory, and antihyperglycemic actions). In contrast to commercially available drugs, curcumin is believed to be devoid of any major side effects. Thus the aim of the present review is to summarize our current understanding of curcumin's pharmacological actions (specifically antiinflammatory, antioxidant, antidepressant, and neuroprotective) and shed a light on its therapeutic potential to be relevant for treating various chronic conditions, such as neurological and psychological disorders.},

abstract = {Curcumin, a polyphenolic antioxidant derived from a dietary spice, exhibits anticancer activity in rodents and in humans. Its efficacy appears to be related to induction of glutathione S-transferase enzymes, inhibition of prostag-landin E 2 (PGE 2) production, or suppression of oxidative DNA adduct (M 1 G) formation. We designed a dose-escalation study to explore the pharmacology of curcumin in humans. Fifteen patients with advanced colorectal cancer refractory to standard chemotherapies consumed capsules compatible with curcumin doses between 0.45 and 3.6 g daily for up to 4 months. Levels of curcumin and its metab-olites in plasma, urine, and feces were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Three biomarkers of the potential activity of curcumin were translated from preclinical models and measured in patient blood leukocytes: glutathione S-transferase activity, levels of M 1 G, and PGE 2 production induced ex vivo. Dose-limiting toxicity was not observed. Curcumin and its glucuronide and sulfate metabolites were detected in plasma in the 10 nmol/L range and in urine. A daily dose of 3.6 g curcumin engendered 62% and 57% decreases in inducible PGE 2 production in blood samples taken 1 hour after dose on days 1 and 29, respectively, of treatment compared with levels observed immediately predose (P < 0.05). A daily oral dose of 3.6 g of curcumin is advocated for Phase II evaluation in the prevention or treatment of cancers outside the gastroin-testinal tract. PGE 2 production in blood and target tissue may indicate biological activity. Levels of curcumin and its metabolites in the urine can be used to assess general compliance .},

abstract = {Purpose: CMC 2.24, a chemically modified curcumin, was developed as a novel, pleiotropic MMP-inhibitor to treat various inflammatory/collagenolytic diseases including periodontitis. To date, this compound has shown efficacy in vitro, in cell culture, and in vivo (oral administration) in mice, rats and dogs. In preparation for possible Phase I human clinical trials, the current study describes the maximum-tolerated-dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of CMC 2.24 in the rat model. Methods: For the MTD study, 30 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly distributed into 5 groups (3M/3F per group): Placebo (vehicle; carboxymethylcellulose) and CMC 2.24 at various doses (50, 100, 500, 1000 mg/kg/day), were administered once daily by oral gavage for 5 days. For the PK study, 24 rats were administered either Placebo or CMC 2.24 (100mg/kg/day) once daily for 28 days or only once (500 or 1000 mg/kg). Analysis of this test compound was done using LC/MS/MS for PK evaluation on blood samples drawn from rats at multiple time points. The animals were sacrificed after 5 or 28 days of treatment, and blood chemistry and serology were analyzed. Major organs (heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, brain) were histologically examined at necropsy. Results: Orally administered, CMC 2.24 did not produce significant changes in body weight, food consumption or adverse events in the MTD and toxicology studies. Moreover, no obvious pathologic changes were observed based on histology, hematology, serum biochemistry, or necropsy compared to placebo-treated controls. The PK study demonstrated a peak-blood concentration (Cmax) at 45 mins after oral administration of 2.24 and a serum half-life of 10 hours. Conclusion: In conclusion, CMC 2.24, orally administered to rats once a day, appears to be safe and effective at a wide range of doses, consistent with efficacy previously demonstrated in studies on animal models of various collagenolytic diseases, such as periodontitis, diabetes and cancer.},

Methods: We systematically reviewed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on curcuminoids in knee osteoarthritis from the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, AMED, Cinahl, ISI Web of Science, Chinese medical database, and Indian Scientiﬁc databases from inception to June 21, 2021. Results: We included eleven studies with a total of 1258 participants with primary knee OA. The meta-analysis results showed that curcuminoids were significantly more effective than comparators regarding visual analogue scale (VAS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores. However, no significant difference in pain relief or AEs between the high-dose (daily dose ≥1000 mg or total dose ≥42 gm) and low-dose (daily dose <1000 mg or total dose <42 gm) curcuminoid treatments was observed. When comparing curcumininoids versus NSAIDs, a significant difference in VAS pain was found. For AE analysis, three of our included studies used NSAIDs as comparators, with all reporting higher AE rates in the NSAID group, though significance was reached in only one study. Conclusions: The results of our meta-analysis suggest that low- and high-dose curcuminoids have similar pain relief effects and AEs in knee OA. Curcuminoids are also associated with better pain relief than NSAIDs; therefore, using curcuminoids as an adjunctive treatment in knee OA is recommended.},

This systematic review and meta-analysis was done to summarize data from available clinical trials on the effect of curcumin supplementation on body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), and Waist Circumference (WC). Methods: PubMed, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched to find relevant articles up to August 2018. The effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Subgroup analysis was done to find possible sources of heterogeneity. Results: Totally, 11 studies that enrolled 876 subjects (53% women) were included. Combining effect sizes suggested a significant effect of curcumin administration on body weight (Weighed Mean Difference (WMD): −1.14kg, 95% CI: −2.16, −0.12, P= 0.02) and BMI (WMD: −0.48 kg/m2, 95% CI: −0.78, −0.17, P = 0.002), respectively. However, no significant effect of curcumin supplementation on WC was found (WMD: −1.51 cm, 95% CI: −4.041, 1.003, P = 0.23). Based on subgroup analysis, we found that the effect of curcumin on WC was significant in studies that prescribed ≥1000 mg/d curcumin (P ≤ 0.001), those with the intervention duration of ≥8 weeks (P ≤ 0.001), and those that was performed on overweight subjects (P ≤ 0.001). Conclusions: We found a significant effect of curcumin supplementation on body weight and BMI, but not on WC. However, the effect of curcumin on WC was significant in studies done on overweight subjects, used ≥1000 mg/d curcumin, and ≥8 weeks of duration.},

Establishing the entire toxicological profile is thus indispensable for proving the human safety of nanocarriers, which was the primary objective of the current investigation. The developed curcumin loaded polymeric nanoparticles of Eudragit{\textregistered} S100 were subjected to various toxicological evaluations which included acute-toxicity study, sub-acute-toxicity study (28. days) and various genotoxicity studies like in vivo Micronucleus assay, in vivo Chromosomal Aberration assay and in vivo Comet assay. The formulation was found to be non-toxic at the dose equivalent to 2000. mg/kg of body weight of curcumin in the acute-toxicity study. Sub-acute-toxicity study proved the safety of the formulation for prolonged administration at the commonly used therapeutic dose of 100. mg/kg of body weight of curcumin and at twice the therapeutic dose. Genotoxicity studies proved the cellular safety of the developed formulation at the therapeutic dose, and even at doses equivalent to thrice the therapeutic dose. Thus the developed curcumin loaded polymeric nanoparticles of Eudragit{\textregistered} S100 were found to be safe for oral administration for a short as well as a prolonged duration. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: The polyphenol curcumin is produced in the rhizome of Curcuma longa and exhibits potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and chemopreventive activities. Due to the fact that curcumin is poorly soluble in water, many delivery systems have been developed to improve its solubility and bioavailability achieving optimum therapeutic application. In this study, we evaluated the biological effects of a liposomal curcumin formulation (Lipocurc™) on human synovial fibroblasts (SW982) and mouse macrophages (RAW264).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cellular uptake of liposomes was studied using calcein-loaded liposomes. Effects of Lipocurc™ on cell viability and proliferation were determined with Celltox green cytotoxicity assay and 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay, respectively. To induce cytokine/chemokine expression, the cells were stimulated with interleukin (IL)1$\beta$ or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The release of IL6, IL8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF$\alpha$) was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: Data showed that the liposomal curcumin formulation Lipocurc™ was significantly less toxic to synovial fibroblasts and macrophages compared to non-encapsulated, free curcumin. Furthermore, Lipocurc™ effectively reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression in synovial fibroblasts as well as in macrophages without affecting cell viability, suggesting that this curcumin nanoformulation might be a promising tool for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {Turmeric or curcumin is not only known as a spice or as a food additive (E100). Food
supplements can also contain components of the rhizome of the curcuma plant, often in the
form of curcumin-enriched extracts. In addition, piperine or piperine-enriched extracts from
pepper may also be added to these products. Piperine can increase the bioavailability of
curcumin so that curcumin can be better absorbed by the body.
Within the context of the evaluation of curcumin as a food additive (E100), the European
Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has derived an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for curcumin of 3
mg/kg body weight (bw) and day. The ADI specifies the quantity of a substance that can be
consumed on a daily basis over an entire lifetime without a detectable risk to health. The
German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has used this value as a basis for the
assessment of health risks from curcumin in food, in particular from curcumin-enriched food
supplements. In the long term, the total intake of curcumin from all sources should not
exceed 3 mg/kg bw per day. Besides food supplements, curcumin sources can also be food
additives or spices. If this value is exceeded over a longer period of time, even slightly,
adverse health effects may occur. This applies especially to sensitive individuals in the
population.
In particular, the BfR has assessed the health risks that might be associated with the
consumption of food supplements containing curcumin to which piperine has been added in
order to increase the bioavailability of curcumin. However, since the exact composition of
such products can vary considerably, a general assessment is not possible from the BfR's
point of view. An assessment should always be made on the basis of a specific product with
a known composition. Within this context, there is also a fundamental need for research on
the toxicity of preparations containing curcumin with improved bioavailability. One aspect
here is the question of a possible liver-damaging effect of these products, which cannot yet
be adequately answered. Potentially liver-damaging effects have already been observed with
curcumin-containing products with improved bioavailability, often through the addition of
piperine. In some cases, however, these products also contained other components that
could also be (partly) responsible for this.},

abstract = {Background: To identify associations between polyphenol intake and health and disease outcomes in cohort studies, it is important to identify biomarkers of intake for the various compounds commonly consumed as part of the diet. Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the usefulness of polyphenol metabolites excreted in urine as biomarkers of polyphenol intake in humans. Design: The method included a structured search strategy for polyphenol intervention studies on Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE (Ovid), and Cochrane databases; formal inclusion and exclusion criteria; data extraction into an Access database; validity assessment; and meta-analysis. Results: One hundred sixty-two controlled intervention studies with polyphenols were included, and mean recovery yield and correlations with the dose ingested were determined for 40 polyphenols. Polyphenols such as daidzein, genistein, glycitein, enterolactone, and hydroxytyrosol showed both a high recovery yield (12-37%) and a high correlation with the dose (Pearson's correlation coefficients: 0.67-0.87), which showed good sensitivity and robustness as biomarkers of intake throughout the different studies. Weaker recovery for anthocyanins (0.06-0.2%) and weaker correlations with dose [Pearson's correlation coefficients: 0.21-0.52 for hesperidin, naringenin, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, quercetin, and 3 microbial metabolites of isoflavones (dihydrodaidzein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin)] suggest that they are currently less suitable as biomarkers of intake.

However, no such database is specifically focused on foods and more precisely on polyphenols, one of the major classes of phytochemicals. As antioxidants, polyphenols influence human health and may play a role in the prevention of a number of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, some cancers or type 2 diabetes. To determine polyphenol intake in populations and study their association with health, it is essential to have detailed information on their content in foods. However this information is not easily collected due to the variety of their chemical structures and the variability of their content in a given food. Phenol-Explorer is the first comprehensive web-based database on polyphenol content in foods. It contains more than 37,000 original data points collected from 638 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals. The quality of these data has been evaluated before they were aggregated to produce final representative mean content values for 502 polyphenols in 452 foods. The web interface allows making various queries on the aggregated data to identify foods containing a given polyphenol or polyphenols present in a given food. For each mean content value, it is possible to trace all original content values and their literature sources. Phenol-Explorer is a major step forward in the development of databases on food constituents and the food metabolome.

abstract = {Polyphenols (PPs) are the naturally occurring bioactive components in fruits and vegeta-bles, and they are the most abundant antioxidant in the human diet. Studies are suggesting that ingestion of PPs might be helpful to ameliorate metabolic syndromes that may contribute in the prevention of several chronic disorders like diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and colon cancer. PPs have structural diversity which impacts their bioavailability as they accumulate in the large intestine and are extensively metabolized through gut microbiota (GM). Intestinal microbiota transforms PPs into their metabolites to make them bioactive. Interestingly, not only GM act on PPs to metabolize them but PPs also modulate the composition of GM. Thus, change in GM from pathogenic to beneficial ones may be helpful to ameliorate gut health and associated diseases. However, to overcome the low bioavailability of PPs, various approaches have been developed to improve their solubility and transportation through the gut. In this review, we present evidence supporting the structural changes that occur after metabolic reactions in PPs (curcumin, quercetin, and catechins) and their effect on GM composition that leads to improving overall gut health and helping to ameliorate metabolic disorders.},

abstract = {The concept of food matrix has received much attention lately in reference to its effects on food processing, nutrition and health. However, the term matrix is used vaguely by food and nutrition scientists, often as synonymous of the food itself or its microstructure. This review analyses the concept of food matrix and proposes a classification for the major types of matrices found in foods. The food matrix may be viewed as a physical domain that contains and/or interacts with specific constituents of a food (e.g., a nutrient) providing functionalities and behaviors which are different from those exhibited by the components in isolation or a free state. The effect of the food matrix (FM-effect) is discussed in reference to food processing, oral processing and flavor perception, satiation and satiety, and digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. The FM-effect has also implications in nutrition, food allergies and food intolerances, and in the quality and relevance of results of analytical techniques. The role of the food matrix in the design of healthy foods is also discussed.},

abstract = {Phenol-Explorer, launched in 2009, is the only comprehensive web-based database on the content in foods of polyphenols, a major class of food bioactives that receive considerable attention due to their role in the prevention of diseases. Polyphenols are rarely absorbed and excreted in their ingested forms, but extensively metabolized in the body, and until now, no database has allowed the recall of identities and concentrations of polyphenol metabolites in biofluids after the consumption of polyphenol-rich sources. Knowledge of these metabolites is essential in the planning of experiments whose aim is to elucidate the effects of polyphenols on health. Release 2.0 is the first major update of the database, allowing the rapid retrieval of data on the biotransformations and pharmacokinetics of dietary polyphenols. Data on 375 polyphenol metabolites identified in urine and plasma were collected from 236 peer-reviewed publications on polyphenol metabolism in humans and experimental animals and added to the database by means of an extended relational design. Pharmacokinetic parameters have been collected and can be retrieved in both tabular and graphical form. The web interface has been enhanced and now allows the filtering of information according to various criteria. Phenol-Explorer 2.0, which will be periodically updated, should prove to be an even more useful and capable resource for polyphenol scientists because bioactivities and health effects of polyphenols are dependent on the nature and concentrations of metabolites reaching the target tissues. The Phenol-Explorer database is publicly available and can be found online at http://www.phenol-explorer.eu. Database URL: http://www.phenol-explorer.eu.},

Here, we highlight the investigations of curcumin and other plant-derived polyphenols that demonstrate their application to metabolic diseases, in particular, obesity and diabetes. Thus, a number of preclinical and clinical investigations have shown the beneficial effect of curcumin (and other dietary polyphenols) in attenuating body weight gain, improving insulin sensitivity, and preventing diabetes development in rodent models and prediabetic subjects. Other intervention studies with dietary polyphenols have also found improvements in insulin resistance. Recent studies suggest that the metabolic effects of curcumin/polyphenols are linked to changes in the gut microbiota. Thus, research into curcumin continues to provide novel insights into metabolic regulation that may ultimately translate into effective therapy.},

abstract = {Gut microbiota (GM) plays several crucial roles in host physiology and influences several relevant functions. In more than one respect, it can be said that you "feed your microbiota and are fed by it." GM diversity is affected by diet and influences metabolic and immune functions of the host's physiology. Consequently, an imbalance of GM, or dysbiosis, may be the cause or at least may lead to the progression of various pathologies such as infectious diseases, gastrointestinal cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, and even obesity and diabetes. Therefore, GM is an appropriate target for nutritional interventions to improve health. For this reason, phytochemicals that can influence GM have recently been studied as adjuvants for the treatment of obesity and inflammatory diseases. Phytochemicals include prebiotics and probiotics, as well as several chemical compounds such as polyphenols and derivatives, carotenoids, and thiosulfates. The largest group of these comprises polyphenols, which can be subclassified into four main groups: flavonoids (including eight subgroups), phenolic acids (such as curcumin), stilbenoids (such as resveratrol), and lignans. Consequently, in this review, we will present, organize, and discuss the most recent evidence indicating a relationship between the effects of different phytochemicals on GM that affect obesity and/or inflammation, focusing on the effect of approximately 40 different phytochemical compounds that have been chemically identified and that constitute some natural reservoir, such as potential prophylactics, as candidates for the treatment of obesity and inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {Obesity is a global health problem needing urgent research. Synthetic anti-obesity drugs show side effects and variable effectiveness. Thus, there is a tendency to use natural compounds for the management of obesity. There is a considerable body of knowledge, supported by rigorous experimental data, that natural polyphenols, including curcumin, can be an effective and safer alternative for managing obesity. Curcumin is a is an important compound present in Curcuma longa L. rhizome. It is a lipophilic molecule that rapidly permeates cell membrane. Curcumin has been used as a pharmacological traditional medicinal agent in Ayurvedic medicine for ∼6000 years. This plant metabolite doubtless effectiveness has been reported through increasingly detailed in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials. Regarding its biological effects, multiple health-promoting, disease-preventing and even treatment attributes have been remarkably highlighted. This review documents the status of research on anti-obesity mechanisms and evaluates the effectiveness of curcumin for management of obesity. It summarizes different mechanisms of anti-obesity action, associated with the enzymes, energy expenditure, adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, gut microbiota and anti-inflammatory potential of curcumin. However, there is still a need for systematic and targeted clinical studies before curcumin can be used as the mainstream therapy for managing obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of bioelectrical impedance phase angle has been recommended as a prognostic tool in the clinical setting, but published reference data bases are discrepant and incomplete (eg, they do not consider body mass index [BMI], and data are lacking for children). METHODS: Phase angle reference values stratified by age, sex, and BMI were generated in a large German data base of 15,605 children and adolescents and 214,732 adults, and the determinants of phase angle values were assessed. The reference values were applied to 3 groups of patients and compared with previously published reference values from the United States and Switzerland. RESULTS: Gender and age were the main determinants of phase angle in adults, with men and younger subjects having higher phase angles. In children and adolescents, age and BMI were the main determinants of phase angle. In normal and overweight adults, phase angle increased with increasing BMI, but there was an inverse association at a BMI >40 kg/m2. In cirrhosis, the prevalence of a low phase angle increased with the state of disease, whereas it was not different between patients with the metabolic syndrome and controls. There are considerable differences between phase angle reference values from different populations. These differences are not explained by age or BMI and may be due to differences between impedance analyzers. CONCLUSION: The determinants of phase angle differ between adults and children. In adults, the influence of BMI on phase angle depended on the BMI range. The prognostic value of phase angle may differ in different clinical settings. The use of population-specific and probably impedance-analyzer-specific reference values for phase angle is recommended.},

abstract = {Background: Current research suggests that while patients are becoming more engaged across the health delivery spectrum, this involvement occurs most often at the pre-preparation stage to identify 'high-level' priorities in health ecosystem priority setting, and at the preparation phase for health research. Objective: The purpose of this systematic rapid review of the literature is to describe the evidence that does exist in relation to patient and public engagement priority setting in both health ecosystem and health research. Data sources: HealthStar (via OVID); CINAHL; Proquest Databases; and Scholar's Portal. Study eligibility criteria: i) published in English; ii) published within the timeframe of 2007-Current (10 years) unless the report/article was formative in synthesizing key considerations of patient engagement in health ecosystem and health research priority setting; iii) conducted in Canada, the US, Europe, UK, Australia/New Zealand, or Scandinavian countries. Study appraisal and synthesis: i) Is the research valid, sound, and applicable?; ii) what outcomes can we potentially expect if we implement the findings from this research?; iii) will the target population (i.e., health researchers and practitioners) be able to use this research?. A summary of findings from each of the respective processes was synthesized to highlight key information that would support decision-making for researchers when determining the best priority setting process to apply for their specific patient-oriented research. Results: Seventy articles from the UK, US, Canada, Netherlands and Australia were selected for review. Results were organized into two tiers of public and patient engagement in prioritization: Tier 1-Deliberative and Tier 2-Consultative. Highly structured patient and public engagement planning activities include the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnerships (UK), Dialogue Method (Netherlands), Global Evidence Mapping (Australia), and the Deep Inclusion Method/CHoosing All Together (US). Limitations: The critical study limitations include challenges in comprehensively identifying the patient engagement literature for review, bias in article selection due to the identified scope, missed information due to a more limited use of exhaustive search strategies (e.g., in-depth hand searching), and the heterogeneity of reported study findings. Conclusion: The four public and patient engagement priority setting processes identified were successful in setting priorities that are inclusive and objectively based, specific to the priorities of stakeholders engaged in the process. The processes were robust, strategic and aimed to promote equity in patient voices. Key limitations identified a lack of evaluation data on the success and extent in which patients were engaged. Issues pertaining to feasibility of stakeholder engagement, coordination, communication and limited resources were also considered.},

abstract = {Objective To report the improvements achieved with clinical decision support systems and examine the heterogeneity from pooling effects across diverse clinical settings and intervention targets. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Medline up to August 2019. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies and methods Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials reporting absolute improvements in the percentage of patients receiving care recommended by clinical decision support systems. Multilevel meta-analysis accounted for within study clustering. Meta-regression was used to assess the degree to which the features of clinical decision support systems and study characteristics reduced heterogeneity in effect sizes. Where reported, clinical endpoints were also captured. Results In 108 studies (94 randomised, 14 quasi-randomised), reporting 122 trials that provided analysable data from 1 203 053 patients and 10 790 providers, clinical decision support systems increased the proportion of patients receiving desired care by 5.8% (95% confidence interval 4.0% to 7.6%). This pooled effect exhibited substantial heterogeneity (I 2 =76%), with the top quartile of reported improvements ranging from 10% to 62%. In 30 trials reporting clinical endpoints, clinical decision support systems increased the proportion of patients achieving guideline based targets (eg, blood pressure or lipid control) by a median of 0.3% (interquartile range -0.7% to 1.9%). Two study characteristics (low baseline adherence and paediatric settings) were associated with significantly larger effects. Inclusion of these covariates in the multivariable meta-regression, however, did not reduce heterogeneity. Conclusions Most interventions with clinical decision support systems appear to achieve small to moderate improvements in targeted processes of care, a finding confirmed by the small changes in clinical endpoints found in studies that reported them. A minority of studies achieved substantial increases in the delivery of recommended care, but predictors of these more meaningful improvements remain undefined.},

abstract = {Background: The clinical decision support system(CDSS) has potential to improving medication safety. However, the effects of the intervention were conflicting and uncertain. Meanwhile, the reporting and methodological quality of this field were unknown. Objective: The aim of this overview is to evaluate the effects of CDSS on medication safety and to examine the methodological and reporting quality. Methods: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched to August 2015. Systematic reviews (SRs) investigating the effects of CDSS on medication safety were included. Outcomes were determined in advance and assessed separately for process of care and patient outcomes. The methodological quality was assessed by Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) and the reporting quality was examined by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Results: Twenty systematic reviews, consisting of 237 unique randomized controlled trials(RCTs) and 176 non-RCTs were included. Evidence that CDSS significantly impacted process of care was found in 108 out of 143 unique studies of the 16 SRs examining this effect (75%). Only 18 out of 90 unique studies of the 13 SRs reported significantly evidence that CDSS positively impacted patient outcomes (20%). Ratings for the overall scores of AMSTAR resulted in a mean score of 8.3 with a range of scores from 7.5 to 10.5. The reporting quality was varied. Some contents were particularly strong. However, some contents were poor. Conclusions: CDSS reduces medication error by obviously improving process of care and inconsistently improving patient outcomes. Larger samples and longer-term studies are required to ensure more reliable evidence base on the effects of CDSS on patient outcomes. The methodological and reporting quality were varied and some realms need to be improved.},

abstract = {Objectives: Evaluate potassium and phosphorus repletion in hospitalized patients. Assess the potential role for use of various methods, including healthcare information technology, to improve prescribing and patient safety. Research design and methods: Inpatient medication profiles were screened to identify orders for potassium and phosphorus replacement products. Electronic laboratory and medical records were used to evaluate efficacy and safety. Eligibility for oral therapy was defined by the presence of other scheduled oral medications on the medication profile. Appropriateness of prescribing was based on adherence to the hospital guidelines for repletion. Results: Overall, 134 orders for potassium in 92 patients and 36 orders for phosphorus in 27 patients were evaluated over a 3-week data collection period. Intravenous (IV) potassium was prescribed in 73% of replacement episodes (46% as single doses and 54% within large volume IV fluids), with 85% for normokalemia or mild-to-moderate cases of hypokalemia. Phosphorus orders involved single doses of IV potassium phosphate (mean 13.1 mmol) in 75% of cases. Approximately 85% of doses were for mild or moderate hypophosphatemia. Eligibility for oral therapy was evident in 74% of normokalemic or mild hypokalemic cases receiving IV potassium products and in 33% of cases receiving IV phosphorus replacement. Six cases of mild hyperkalemia were observed. No hyperphosphatemia was documented. Study limitations include use of a retrospective design, inability to discern whether some electrolyte doses were given with a preventative intent, potential overestimation of the number of patients eligible for oral repletion, and lack of data on the accessibility of the laboratory serum concentrations or the awareness of serum values to the prescribers. Conclusions: Intravenous potassium and phosphate products are commonly prescribed for mild or moderate cases of hypokalemia or hypophosphatemia. Many patients met eligibility for oral therapy. Efforts to enhance prescriber education and implement computerized prescribing and decision support systems have the potential to improve prescribing and reduce possibilities of adverse drug events and medication errors related to potassium and phosphate administration. {\textcopyright} 2006 Librapharm Limited.},

Their measurement is increasingly considered in clinical practice; however, paediatricians are often unsure as to which techniques are appropriate and suitable for application in specific contexts. This article summarises the pros and cons of measurement technologies currently available for paediatric application. Simple techniques are adequate for many purposes, and simple regional data may often be of greater value than "whole body" values obtained by more sophisticated approaches.},

abstract = {Background/objectives: Calf circumference (CC) is an indirect method used to evaluate muscle mass in older adults. Ultrasound has also been studied as a method for measuring muscle mass. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to correlate CC and muscle thickness of the medial gastrocnemius muscle (MGM) in healthy older women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 74 healthy older women. The MGM thickness was evaluated using an ultrasound device (Logiq Book XP, General Electric{\textregistered}). The reference value for adequate CC was ≥ 31 cm. Weight and height were measured for the calculation of the body mass index (BMI), which was dichotomized as with or without excess weight based on the cutoff points recommended by the World Health Organization (1995); Lipschitz (1994) and the Pan-American Health Organization (2001). Results: All participants were ≥ 64 years of age. Mean weight and height were 66.19 kg (SD: 10.48) and 1.55 m (SD: 0.06), respectively. Half of the participants had a BMI higher than 27.53 kg/m2. Moderate positive correlations were found between CC and MGM thickness ($\rho$ = 0.432; p < 0.001), MGM thickness and weight (r = 0.422; p < 0.001) and between MGM thickness and BMI (r = 0.438; p < 0.001). However, the correlation between CC and MGM thickness was non-significant among the women with excess weight. Conclusions: A moderate positive correlation between MGM thickness and CC was found in healthy older women. However, this correlation was weak and non-significant among those with excess weight.},

@article{Efron2018,
abstract = {As early as the 1990s, chronic critical illness, a distinct syndrome of persistent high-acuity illness requiring management in the ICU, was reported under a variety of descriptive terms including the “neuropathy of critical illness,” “myopathy of critical illness,” “ICU-acquired weakness,” and most recently “post-intensive care unit syndrome.” The widespread implementation of targeted shock resuscitation, improved organ support modalities, and evidence-based protocolized ICU care has resulted in significantly decreased in-hospital mortality within surgical ICUs, specifically by reducing early multiple organ failure deaths. However, a new phenotype of multiple organ failure has now emerged with persistent but manageable organ dysfunction, high resource utilization, and discharge to prolonged care facilities. This new multiple organ failure phenotype is now clinically associated with the rapidly increasing incidence of chronic critical illness in critically ill surgery patients. Although the underlying pathophysiology driving chronic critical illness remains incompletely described, the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome has been proposed as a mechanistic framework in which to explain the increased incidence of chronic critical illness in surgical ICUs. The purpose of this review is to provide a historic perspective of the epidemiologic evolution of multiple organ failure into persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome; describe the mechanism that drives and sustains chronic critical illness, and review the long-term outcomes of surgical patients who develop chronic critical illness.},

abstract = {Persistent Inflammation, Immunosuppression, and Catabolism Syndrome (PICS) is a clinical endotype of chronic critical illness. PICS consists of a self-perpetuating cycle of ongoing organ dysfunction, inflammation, and catabolism resulting in sarcopenia, immunosuppression leading to recurrent infections, metabolic derangements, and changes in bone marrow function. There is heterogeneity regarding the definition of PICS. Currently, there are no licensed treatments specifically for PICS. However, findings can be extrapolated from studies in other conditions with similar features to repurpose drugs, and in animal models. Drugs that can restore immune homeostasis by stimulating lymphocyte production could have potential efficacy. Another treatment could be modifying myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) activation after day 14 when they are immunosuppressive. Drugs such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 receptor antagonists might reduce persistent inflammation, although they need to be given at specific time points to avoid adverse effects. Antioxidants could treat the oxidative stress caused by mitochondrial dysfunction in PICS. Possible anti-catabolic agents include testosterone, oxandrolone, IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1), bortezomib, and MURF1 (muscle RING-finger protein-1) inhibitors. Nutritional support strategies that could slow PICS progression include ketogenic feeding and probiotics. The field would benefit from a consensus definition of PICS using biologically based cut-off values. Future research should focus on expanding knowledge on underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PICS to identify and validate other potential endotypes of chronic critical illness and subsequent treatable traits. There is unlikely to be a universal treatment for PICS, and a multimodal, timely, and personalised therapeutic strategy will be needed to improve outcomes for this growing cohort of patients.},

abstract = {Background: Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) has been described in critically ill adults and may contribute to unfavourable outcomes. The present study aimed to describe and characterise PICS in critically ill children (PICS-ped) and to verify its association with clinical outcomes. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted in a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with children aged between 3 months and 15 years. PICS-ped, based on adult definition, was described. PICS-ped was defined as PICU length of stay >14 days; C-reactive protein > 10.0 mg L−1; lymphocytes <25%; and any reduction of mid-upper arm circumference Z-score. Clinical, demographic, nutritional status, nutrition therapy parameters and clinical outcomes were assessed. Statistical analysis comprised Mann–Whitney and Fisher's chi-squared tests, as well as logistic and Cox regression. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In total, 153 children were included, with a median age of 51.7 months (interquartile range 15.6–123.4 months), and 60.8% male. The mortality rate was 10.5%. The prevalence of PICS-ped was 4.6%. Days using vasoactive drugs and days using antibiotics were associated with PICS-ped. PICS-ped was associated with mortality in crude (odds ratio = 6.67; P = 0.013) and adjusted analysis (odds ratio = 7.14; P = 0.017). PICS-ped was also associated with PICU and hospital length of stay, as well as duration of mechanical ventilation. Similar results were found in a subset of critically ill children who required mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h. Conclusions: Children with PICS-ped required antibiotics or vasoactive drugs for a longer period. PICS-ped was associated with poor clinical outcomes in critically ill children. More studies are needed to properly define PICS-ped for this population.},

abstract = {Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) stay of longer than 10 days is often described by the experienced intensivist as a "complicated clinical course" and is frequently attributed to persistent immune dysfunction. "Systemic inflammatory response syndrome" (SIRS) followed by "compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome" (CARS) is a conceptual framework to explain the immunologic trajectory that ICU patients with severe sepsis, trauma, or emergency surgery for abdominal infection often traverse, but the causes, mechanisms, and reasons for persistent immune dysfunction remain unexplained. Often involving multiple-organ failure (MOF) and death, improvements in surgical intensive care have altered its incidence, phenotype, and frequency and have increased the number of patients who survive initial sepsis or surgical events and progress to a persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS). Often observed, but rarely reversible, these patients may survive to transfer to a long-term care facility only to return to the ICU, but rarely to selfsufficiency. We propose that PICS is the dominant pathophysiology and phenotype that has replaced late MOFand prolongs surgical ICU stay, usually with poor outcome. This review details the evolving epidemiology of MOF, the clinical presentation of PICS, and our understanding of how persistent inflammation and immunosuppression define the pathobiology of prolonged intensive care. Therapy for PICS will involve innovative interventions for immune system rebalance and nutritional support to regain physical function and wellbeing.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Sepsis-associated immune suppression correlates with poor outcomes. Adult trials are evaluating immune support therapies. Limited data exist to support consideration of immunomodulation in pediatric sepsis. We tested the hypothesis that early, persistent lymphopenia predicts worse outcomes in pediatric severe sepsis. DESIGN: Observational cohort comparing children with severe sepsis and early, persistent lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count < 1,000 cells/µL on 2 d between study days 0-5) to children without. The composite outcome was prolonged multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS, organ dysfunction beyond day 7) or PICU mortality. SETTING: Nine PICUs in the National Institutes of Health Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network between 2015 and 2017. PATIENTS: Children with severe sepsis and indwelling arterial and/or central venous catheters. INTERVENTIONS: Blood sampling and clinical data analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 401 pediatric patients with severe sepsis, 152 (38%) had persistent lymphopenia. These patients were older, had higher illness severity, and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities including solid organ transplant or malignancy. Persistent lymphopenia was associated with the composite outcome prolonged MODS or PICU mortality (66/152, 43% vs 45/249, 18%; p < 0.01) and its components prolonged MODS (59/152 [39%] vs 43/249 [17%]), and PICU mortality (32/152, 21% vs 12/249, 5%; p < 0.01) versus children without. After adjusting for baseline factors at enrollment, the presence of persistent lymphopenia was associated with an odds ratio of 2.98 (95% CI [1.85-4.02]; p < 0.01) for the composite outcome. Lymphocyte count trajectories showed that patients with persistent lymphopenia generally did not recover lymphocyte counts during the study, had lower nadir whole blood tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation, and higher maximal inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and ferritin) during days 0-3 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Children with severe sepsis and persistent lymphopenia are at risk of prolonged MODS or PICU mortality. This evidence supports testing therapies for pediatric severe sepsis patients risk-stratified by early, persistent lymphopenia.},

Despite its hypothesized immune-mediated mechanism, targeted immunotherapy for sepsis is not available for clinical use.Objective:To determine the association between longitudinal cytometric, proteomic, bioenergetic, and metabolomic markers of immunometabolic dysregulation and pathogen type in pediatric sepsis.Methods:Serial peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were obtained from 14 sepsis patients (34 total samples) and 7 control patients for this observational study. Flow cytometry was used to define immunophenotype, including T cell subset frequency and activation state, and assess intracellular cytokine production. Global immune dysfunction was assessed by tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) production capacity and monocyte human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) expression. Mitochondrial function was assessed by bulk respirometry. Plasma cytokine levels were determined via Luminex assay. Metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results were compared by timepoint and pathogen type.Results:Sepsis patients were older (15.9 years vs. 10.4 years, P = 0.02) and had higher illness severity by PRISM-III (12.0 vs. 2.0, P < 0.001) compared to controls; demographics were otherwise similar, though control patients were predominately male. Compared to controls, sepsis patients at timepoint 1 demonstrated lower monocyte HLA-DR expression (75% vs. 92%, P = 0.02), loss of peripheral of non-na{\"{i}}ve CD4+T cells (62.4% vs. 77.6%, P = 0.04), and reduced PBMC mitochondrial spare residual capacity (SRC; 4.0 pmol/s/106cells vs. 8.4 pmol/s/106cells, P = 0.01). At sepsis onset, immunoparalysis (defined as TNF-$\alpha$ production capacity < 200 pg/mL) was present in 39% of sepsis patients and not identified among controls. Metabolomic findings in sepsis patients were most pronounced at sepsis onset and included elevated uridine and 2-dehydrogluconate and depleted citrulline. Loss of peripheral non-na{\"{i}}ve CD4+T cells was associated with immune dysfunction and reduced cytokine production despite increased T cell activation. CD4+T cell differentiation and corresponding pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines varied by pathogen.Conclusion:Pediatric sepsis patients exhibit a complex, dynamic physiologic state characterized by impaired T cell function and immunometabolic dysregulation which varies by pathogen type.},

We hypothesized that prolonged lymphopenia, lymphoid depletion, and hypoprolactinemia occur in children dying with sepsis and multiple organ failure (MOF). Fifty-eight critically ill children with and 55 without MOF admitted to a university hospital pediatric intensive care unit were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal, observational clinical study. Prolactin levels and absolute lymphocyte count were measured on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21. Lymph node, thymus, and spleen autopsy specimens were examined for lymphoid depletion, with immunohistochemical staining for CD4, CD20, and CD21 and for lymphoid apoptosis. Prolonged lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count < 1000 for >7 days) occurred only in children with MOF (29 vs 0%, p < 0.05) and was associated independently with nosocomial infection (odds ratio (OR), 5.5, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7–17, p < 0.05), death (OR, 6.8, 95% CI, 1.3–34, p < 0.05), and splenic and lymph node hypocellularity (OR, 42, 95% CI, 3.7–473, p < 0.05). Lymphocyte apoptosis and ante/postmortem infection were observed only in children with lymphoid depletion. Prolonged hypoprolactinemia (>7 days) was more common in children with MOF (17 vs 2%, p < 0.05) and was associated independently with prolonged lymphopenia (OR, 8.3, 95% CI, 2.1–33, p < 0.05) and lymphoid depletion (OR, 12.2, 95% CI, 2.2–65, p < 0.05). Prolonged lymphopenia and apoptosis-associated depletion of lymphoid organs play a role in nosocomial sepsis-related death in critically ill children. Prolonged hypoprolactinemia is a previously unrecognized risk factor for this syndrome.},
